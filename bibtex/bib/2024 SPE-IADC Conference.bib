	abstract		= {The subsea test tree is a singular subsea safety solution for well test and cleanup operations from any floating rig. The test tree provides wellbore access, dual-barrier well control, and a reliable, fast-acting means to shut in a well and disconnect, in the event of an emergency. Currently, the ability to run and operate the string is severely dependent on the weather conditions due to its influence on the riser flex joint angles. Therefore, the maximum allowable flex joint angle places severe limitations on the weather operating windows. This study outlines the use of computational analysis to formulate the design changes that are needed to extend the current capabilities of the latch mechanism that secures the landing string inside the Blow Out Preventer (BOP). Simulations are conducted using a design of experiments methodology to enhance the asset’s bending ratings. A parametric analysis is conducted and components with geometric features that can potentially impede the sliding motion of the landing string, such as the latch skirt are explicitly modeled.  The finite element analysis (FEA) technique is used to identify the critical components, which can be further optimized to determine the geometric profile, which eventually ensures that the string passes through the riser flex joint without shouldering out at the BOP annular pockets with minimal push or pull force. The study extends the capability of the Subsea Landing String for use with higher flex joint angles and establishes the structural and functional load limits for the different operational scenarios. The solution highlights the importance of using computations in design as a viable alternative to expensive and time consuming experiments, especially when solving complex problems.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this research is to establish a validation process for survey correction algorithms, primarily focusing on the application of Multi-Station Analysis (MSA). While MSA represents a mathematical approach to survey error reduction, the application can result in varying levels of achieved accuracy. The adoption of a validation process to assess the accuracy of an MSA provider’s algorithm and processes would provide a framework within which to evaluate different providers.  The research will give an overview of the error sources in the ISCWSA error model and their impact on MWD surveys. A simulated well with survey depths and six-axis data will give a true known position of a well’s bottom hole location. Using the error model, randomized errors will be applied to the six-axis values to create a corrupted bottom hole location. A 3rd party proctor will distribute the corrupted six-axis data of 12 wells in varying azimuthal directions to the MSA provider to process through their algorithm. The corrected wellbore position will be returned to the proctor.  A chi-squared analysis of the results will show if the corrected wellbore positions fall within the expected accuracy level based on the error model. Companies will be assessed on both speed and accuracy. The results of the validation trial will establish the accuracy level that the MSA provider is able to achieve under given circumstances. The levels will be determined using wells inside and outside of the East-West Exclusion zone. The validation process will provide clarity to which error models should be assigned to a set of survey data when using a particular provider. For example, a certain provider might be able to achieve MWD+IFR1 accuracy as opposed to MWD+IFR1+MS under certain conditions. Whether or not checkshots are necessary will also be assessed during the validation process. Additionally, only error sources contained in the ISCWSA error model will be evaluated, and the magnitudes will be within the bounds of what can be reasonably expected in field application. Validation is widely accepted across many industries, including the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries, as a benchmark to ensure the safety of those using their products. As for MSA, improper application could cause inaccurate well placement resulting in well-collisions, or unknowingly crossing lease lines.  When planning a well, an Oil \\\& Gas company will be able to determine which MSA provider is qualified to provide accurate services based solely on the azimuthal direction of their wellbore and the target error model that they would like to achieve. The validation process will provide transparency to the MSA survey correction process and allow Oil \\\& Gas companies to ensure that the purchased product is meeting the advertised accuracy level.}

	abstract		= {Inorganic geopolymers typically consist of aluminosilicate-rich powders and alkali silicate solutions as hardeners. When these components are mixed, geopolymers exhibit a behavior similar to that of cement. The final product leaves a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to conventional cement. This paper offers a comprehensive characterization of a granite-based geopolymer designed for oilfield applications, adhering to the standard tests specified by API RP 10B-2. It also highlights the advantages and current limitations of this innovative technology while identifying areas for further research and development.  This geopolymer has been specifically engineered to completely replace Ordinary Portland Cement in well cementing applications. We conducted a series of tests, following API standards, to evaluate its fluid-state properties, including viscosity, static gel strength, thickening time, static fluid-loss, free fluid, and density. Additionally, we examined its mechanical properties after solidification, such as sonic strength development, uniaxial compressive strength, and volume change. Our analysis of the granite-based geopolymer demonstrates the effective performance of the dispersant, reducing viscosity, and enhancing mixability. We observed a brief gel transition time upon setting, and the mix exhibited slight expansion during the strength development phase. Notably, strength development remained continuous and did not plateau even after 30 days of curing. These geopolymers combine high compressive strength with exceptional flexibility. Furthermore, temperature sensitivity analysis revealed that an 8ºC increase did not affect the gelation time.  This granite-based geopolymer is a cement-free system with a low calcium content, measuring less than 15\% by weight. It presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for replacing Portland cement in oil wells, both during well construction and abandonment. Moreover, it proves to be an excellent choice for constructing CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) and geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Drilling process automation has been a trending topic within the technical community, most recently discussed in SPE-212565-MS (Cayeux et al. 2023). Recovery control - specifically in the case of motor stalls - is not only integral to consistently completing automation control system execution, but also building confidence for the control system users and ultimate automation benefactors. Predicting, preventing, detecting, mitigating, and recovering motor stalls through automated recovery control solves an issue affecting most operators, contributing to additional bottom-hole assembly (BHA) damage and unplanned trips.  The recovery control system was designed with six major process control interfaces, two of which occur during on-bottom drilling: drilling while rotating and drilling while sliding. Each control interface is a means by which an external system can control the rig tools in a coordinated fashion, managing what control is currently active and ensuring the driller can ultimately assume control at any given time. The recovery control is customized and preconfigured with an observation window to execute the recovery process once the stall criteria has been breached while on-bottom drilling, sliding or rotating. The result is mitigated motor stalls that are consistently managed with a configurable automation system, less BHA damage, and no motor stall related unplanned trips - displaying both time and cost value.  After two years of testing the recovery control system internally, there were no undetected stalls, no false detections, and no unplanned trips due to motor stall, displaying detailed accuracy. The recovery control complements the process control, limit control, and manual control components of the automation control system to drill a stand effectively and consistently.  A complete and effective automation control system gives time back to the rig crew and allows for leadership development opportunities. The reliability gained through recovery control, faster than manual attempts, allows the driller to focus more time on safety and training the rig crew instead of monitoring differential pressure in the hopes of manually preventing a motor stall. In nearly all cases, stalls were detected faster with the automatic recovery control system compared to manual detection by the driller. Drillers cannot be expected to pay attention to the hundreds of potential drilling problems - a control system can.  There are systems claiming to identify motor stalls, but this recovery control is the only technology to date that actively detects and recovers the system from the stall.}

	abstract		= {Being able to automate the Directional Drilling (DD) process has significant sustainability effects on the well construction through remote operations and also increased efficiency on the usage of drilling rigs.  In this paper, we will present our advancement on autonomous directional drilling highlighting recent achievements in delivering autonomous sections in numerous fields around the world.  Achieving this fully autonomous mode with rotary steerable system (RSS) applications is not a small feat. It requires state estimation algorithms that can fuse all available downhole measurements to precisely predict the location of the bit at all times. These outputs can further estimate the steering capacity while the bottomhole assembly (BHA) navigates through different formation layers to include a surface deviation controller, which will actively monitor any unexpected deviations and will take the appropriate course of actions to rectify the situation. The state estimation is then fed into a surface automation algorithm that will automatically perform the necessary downlinks and engage suitable downhole control modes inside the RSS tool.  Our autonomous directional drilling system is being utilized and field tested across numerous locations. The system derives the steering recommendations and automatically sends downlinks via the on-target well delivery solution system. This system provides the flexibility for our customers to better design their wellsite footprint accommodating traditional crew models or the ability to operate completely remote. It has been deployed in many countries and with different complexity of directional drilling BHAs. For RSS applications, the solution utilizes both surface and downhole technologies, that creates a symbiosis between the downhole close-loop control and the surface close-loop control for directional drilling.  A novel autonomous directional drilling solution is described here. This intelligent system can automatically derive and execute directional drilling decisions while augmenting the technical personnel’s insights into the drilling process whether they are still on the wellsite or in a remote operation center.}

	abstract		= {High frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a major contributing factor to the drilling dynamics-related bottomhole assembly (BHA) failures. These failures are costly because they not only damage the drilling tools but also cause significant nonproductive time (NPT) to the operational activity. It is therefore highly desirable to measure and mitigate this dysfunction in real time.  We have built a high-performance drilling dynamics module, which enables real-time or recorded mode measurements of this HFTO phenomenon. Using this measurement, we can deliver actionable insights to the rig or the rig crew in real time. With data from more than 3000 runs, we can build a clearer understanding of the real characteristics of HFTO, its drivers, and the effects it has on our drilling systems.  We show that with increasing Weight on Bit (WOB) the amplitude of the HFTO will increase. However, at high WOB the dysfunction amplitude will drop, while the ROP continues to rise. As such there is a sweet spot with high ROP and low HFTO.  By integrating this database of drilling dysfunctions with our records of tool damage and nonproductive time, we can map the effect of HFTO onto different failure criteria. As a result, we can define new and better operational standards and generate real-time insights into what damage is more likely to occur and how to change drilling parameters, if needed, to prevent it or determine if the vibration will pass without incident.  We also show that although the rotary steerable tools we use are sensitive to the effect of HFTO, our measurement while drilling (MWD) tools are not. For this latter group the probability of damage is the same for runs with and without HFTO.  This paper discusses the method and results for this study.}

	abstract		= {The drive to reduce freshwater consumption has led to a significant increase in the use of waste streams, such as high salinity produced water brines, as base fluids in drilling fluid systems. However, the performance of conventional lubricants is typically reduced in such brines. This paper describes the design and development of a new class of lubricant specifically designed for use in high salinity water-based drilling fluids.  A comprehensive literature review and a detailed laboratory testing program were undertaken to investigate the mechanism of drilling fluid lubricants under downhole conditions. The knowledge gained from this study was used to design a new class of lubricant that undergoes a chemical reaction with high salinity brines in order to activate the lubricant species and maximize performance.  A series of field trials were conducted on wells targeting the Montney formation in Western Canada. The drilling fluids consisted of solids-free sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and produced water brines with densities ranging from 1080 – 1330 kg/m3. The wells had lateral lengths ranging from 1580 \textendash{} 4000 meters. The new lubricant significantly out-performed conventional lubricants on 100\% of the field trials and was able to achieve friction factors close to those of oil-based drilling fluids. A series of in-depth case studies are provided which highlight the unique performance characteristics of this novel drilling fluid lubricant.}

	abstract		= {Rotary steerable systems (RSS) were first introduced as push-the-bit systems in the late 1990s and were drilling in manual mode sending downlinks by mud pulses downhole. The point-the-bit RSS was introduced in 2003. The first automated mode, known as inclination hold, was introduced in 2003. This was followed by vertical mode in 2004 and by hold inclination and azimuth mode in 2008. The last well profile type, the curve section, was not automated until 2020 when curve control was implemented for push-the-bit RSS. Implementing curve control for push-the-bit RSS has reduced the frequency of downlinks sent from surface and has improved the rate of penetration, thereby supporting a sustainable digital solution for directional drilling and drilling engineering. Curve control for point-the-bit RSS was introduced to the field in mid-2022 and has opened new applications for downhole automation. Point-the-bit RSS has a different steering mechanism (fixed bend) and it has the sensor offset farther from the bit, which creates challenges for implementation of trajectory automation.  In our work, we analysed several case studies and examined new application opportunities for autonomy for trajectory automation based on the field results. Until mid-2022 directional drillers sent manual downlinks to point-the-bit RSS from the surface to follow a planned trajectory and hit the target. These downlinks sent a steering ratio to achieve desired dogleg severity (DLS) and a desired toolface to turn the well if needed. By introducing downhole automation, the Directional Driller is able to send curvature commands, and the tool determines steering ratio to achieve planned DLS by applying a closed-loop algorithm to drill the trajectory. The closed-loop system minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on trajectory response.  Point-the-bit RSS have shown the ability to drill different curve profiles in curve control mode from 2D build to 3D build or drop. Some of the trajectories included a tangent section that were executed with DLS demand of zero. The case studies demonstrate that curve control mode has drilled entire hole sections while reducing the frequency of downlinks, increasing the rate of penetration, and increasing consistency.  Our work examined the next level of downhole automated directional trajectory control for point-the-bit RSS that is currently handled and controlled by the directional drillers (e.g., geometric and geological steering). The curve control mode minimizes the interactions with the surface and allows the driller/surface system to optimize the drilling parameters. The algorithm also minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on the trajectory response.}

	abstract		= {Traditional casing point selection fails to reflect influx dynamics and leverage managed pressure drilling (MPD) advancements in the well design process, which often leads to over-engineering and increased expenditure. This study proposes a new approach that integrates MPD into the casing design process, employing a reduced drift-flux model (RDFM) to account for complexity. The methodology aims to optimize casing design and enable real-time assessment of kick tolerance (KT) while drilling, exploiting opportunities for optimization.  In this study, we present a comprehensive approach for determining kick tolerance thresholds, considering current operating conditions and equipment limitations. Improving on industry-accepted rules of thumb for kick volume (25 bbl) and kick intensity (0.5 ppg), this work delivers a fit-for-purpose kick tolerance criterion. The research indicates that casing point selection can be significantly influenced by previously overlooked factors, such as the impact of temperature on formation stress, kick dilution in drilling fluid and annular distribution, as well as pressure and temperature effects and rig kick detection capabilities. Including these in the design criteria yields more accurate and efficient well construction planning and reduced well control risks. Practical case history results demonstrate the potential to extend critical sections by up to 60\% while increasing the manageable kick volume, consequently eliminating at least 2 casing strings out of a 7 string well design.  The proposed methodology is shown to be suitable for real-time implementation, allowing drillers to make more informed decisions about casing point selection and section length extension while still ensuring safe well operations. This enhances the flexibility of the drilling process and leads to the reduction and simplification of over-engineered well schematics and excess number of casing strings, resulting in significant well construction cost savings.  This work presents a novel approach for MPD well design and casing point selection, considering overlooked factors such as case-specific defined thresholds for kick volume and intensity, complex gas behavior, and temperature-dependent formation stresses for pressure evaluation. Furthermore, it extends the scope to the drilling process by introducing the real-time assessment of KT, generating additional opportunities for optimization, and improving well control safety. In addition, it proves the suitability of an RDFM model for KT assessment.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents an autonomous drilling advisory system powered by digital twins and AI solutions. Such an advisory system aims to automate real-time monitoring and parameter optimization, reduce subject-matter experts, and meet the demands for safer and more efficient drilling toward autonomous operation.  The methodology proposed in this research involves the creation of a comprehensive Digital Twin model that accurately replicates the drilling process by integrating hydraulic, thermal dynamic, and mechanical models. To ensure high model accuracy, an auto-calibration approach is developed, driven by real-time data, to fine-tune the Digital Twin models. Additionally, AI-based model reasoning techniques are employed to detect potential hazards and risks ahead of the bit proactively. This is achieved by comparing the ideal behavior of the digital twin replica with the actual behavior observed from downhole and the rig. As a result, real-time diagnostics are generated to supervise ongoing operations, accompanied by suggestions to mitigate identified risks. Furthermore, the system leverages the capabilities of the Digital Twin and optimization methods to create multiple combinations of operational parameters. These parameters are optimized by ranking the predicted performance derived from the Digital Twin. The optimized operational parameters are automatically generated as forward advice to drillers, enabling them to make informed decisions and enhance drilling performance.  Testing results on multiple wells from different operators are presented, showcasing the system's capabilities in real-time monitoring and drilling parameter optimization. The system demonstrates its effectiveness in providing diagnostic messages with early anomaly detection during drilling and casing running. These diagnostic warnings include losses, leakage, poor hole cleaning, and stuck pipe, enabling proactive intervention to mitigate risks. Furthermore, the system optimizes operational parameters during drilling and tripping in real-time without requiring human intervention. This optimization covers parameters such as flow rate, rotary speed (RPM), and rate of penetration (ROP) during drilling, and tripping speed during tripping in and pulling out of the hole. The time savings achieved through the use of optimized parameters are quantified for both cases, demonstrating a substantial improvement in operational efficiency while maintaining safety margins. The scalability and adaptability of the system are also highlighted, emphasizing its ability to accommodate diverse drilling scenarios and integrate with existing solutions in various deployment conditions.  The proposed methodology demonstrates the development of a robust and efficient system that enhances decision-making and improves drilling performance. In addition, the results highlight the potential benefits of combining AI and Digital Twin technologies in the drilling industry, paving the way for future innovations and advancements in the field.}

	abstract		= {Well construction requires the cooperation of subject matter experts with differing backgrounds. Each discipline has its own viewpoint on the topics addressed by the collaboration team, which complicates multi-disciplinary work. Software tools often embed these differences, rendering the exchange of data subject to the assumptions of the differing backgrounds and disciplines. This can pose significant risk to well, human, asset value and environmental safety. Well construction software applications need to be versatile enough to describe and interpret the meaning of exchanged data while allowing for the inherent assumptions.  Facts about data best describe the meaning of the exchanged data. A semantic network can describe the relationships between concepts or meanings, which it does by collecting and relating facts about the data. The existing data repositories used in well construction use predefined and agreed upon meanings for the contained data. A semantic network, however, allows software applications to interpret the meaning of the transferred data, even when the original meaning and inherent assumptions are different from that of the receiving application. Obviously, the manual generation of such semantic information by end-users is not practical. Each software application needs to generate and interpret semantic information alongside the published data.  A simple example illustrates the potentially costly consequences of the differing meanings of exchanged information in a multi-disciplinary well construction environment. Three different end-users—a geomechanics engineer, a drilling engineer, and a measurement-while-drilling (MWD) engineer\textemdash{}exchange information, using computer applications, about downhole pressure measurements acquired during a drilling operation. The downhole pressures are in equivalent mud weight (EMW) units. Due to the different disciplines involved, each application utilizes a different definition when converting downhole pressure to EMW. The assumptions related to the accuracy of not only the mud density but also the vertical depth, then create expectations that may not be in line with reality, and each of the three different users themselves have different uncertainty expectations.  These different definitions require information on context to avoid misinterpretation. If the three applications can document the meaning of the exchanged data and can interpret the meaning of the received semantical information, then they can mitigate the risk of incorrect interpretation of the EMW data and provide quantification of the associated uncertainties. The scenario described also covers a change in context from conventional drilling to a well control incident. A different interpretation of the meaning of the data must follow the change in context. The paper explains how the three applications can describe the meaning of the exchanged data in order to correctly interpret information and manage the associated uncertainties both in terms of expectations as well as results.  Digitalization of the drilling industry is progressing rapidly, accompanied by the ability to exchange information between computer systems. This clearly breaks down the walls between the different disciplines involved in well planning and drilling operations. It is also important to recognize the uncertainty expectations between disciplines. These expectations must be managed so that the assumptions made are harmonious. To maximize potential opportunities, it is important to maintain the quality of information exchanged between computer systems to mitigate the introduction of significant risk to well, human and environmental safety.}

	abstract		= {Tripping operations are the source of possible serious drilling incidents caused by swab and surge pressures exceeding the geo-pressure margins. Yet, it is difficult to monitor the actual downhole pressure during tripping because of telemetry limitations but also because there are no available methods to measure downhole pressure below the bit. Hydraulic models are therefore necessary to estimate the downhole pressure along the whole open hole section, also below the bit. It is therefore important to understand the factors influencing downhole pressure estimations when the drill-string is only subject to axial displacement.  In most cases tripping procedures consist in a series of drill-string movements intertwined with connection procedures. While tripping, the drill-string needs to accelerate from a stand-still position and to stop at another position. As a result of these accelerations and decelerations, hydraulic calculations must be transient. Furthermore, the movement of the bottom of the string is not synchronous with the top of string displacement because of the elasticity of the string, meaning that transient torque and drag estimations are also necessary. Actually, when using a floater, the top of string movement is influenced by heave also during connection. When the drill-string is displaced, drilling fluid needs to be added or is returned to the trip tank, depending on the direction. Consequently, the drilling fluid columns in the string and in the annulus change position affecting the downhole temperature conditions. As the fluid density and viscous behavior depends much on the local condition of pressure and temperature, heat transfer estimations also play a role on downhole pressure estimations. The evaluation of downhole pressure requires the combined estimations of transient hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer models.  The drilling fluid is also subject to gelling in a non-uniform manner along the borehole. Drilling fluid with high viscosity at low shear rate may take several minutes to return to hydrostatic conditions like for example during connection. Depending on the static and kinetic friction factors, part of the drill-string may remain stretched also after the top of string movement has stopped. Consequently, connection time influences the swab and surge variations for the next stand. Therefore, a tripping operation is typically a non-holonomic process which requires a continuous follow-up of the time evolution of the hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer variables to be able to predict accurately the downhole pressure.  Through several examples from actual tripping operations, the importance of the mutual interaction between transient hydraulic, mechanic and heat transfer, as well as the non-holonomy of tripping operations is shown. Understanding the factors that influence swab and surge estimations is of paramount importance to progress with the automation of tripping operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents the successful development and implementation of a wellbore quality scorecard which is used to evaluate wellbore quality using deterministic and probabilistic methods. This evaluation is based on analysing the real time data during the final trip out of hole with the drilling BHA.  The Wellbore Quality Scorecard is being used systematically across a large multi-asset drilling project where there was a history of problematic hole sections. Casing and liner running operations frequently encountered difficulties, and it was recognised that a system for evaluating the hole condition would help to improve operational decision making. The result of the evaluation is used to provide a better understanding of the condition of the wellbore that was drilled before committing to run casing or liner. Understanding the wellbore condition helps the team to decide, for example, whether to run a wiper trip to condition the wellbore or to save time and go ahead with casing or liner run.  The evaluation process is a collaboration between the remote collaboration centre, the rigsite team and the office-based operations team. A database is generated which records historical wellbore condition vs liner and casing running information which holds very useful technical insights about how each wellbore parameter quantitatively affects the wellbore quality.  The paper will describe how this process has now been applied to over 50 hole sections, and how it has improved decision making and the liner and casing running success rate.  A machine learning model has been developed which predicts the likelihood of successfully running the casing or liner to the target depth. This information is used to compliment the Wellbore Quality Score for informing operational decisions.}

	abstract		= {Displacement to a dedicated screen running fluid (e.g. low-solids mud) is a common method to lower the solids loading of the fluid prior running the completion screens in order to minimize the risk of blockages. However, some advanced drill-in fluids exhibit excellent long-term stabilities under downhole conditions which allow for a dual use also as screen running fluid. A systematic selection of such a fluid for a horizontal well in an oilfield offshore Norway is presented.  Samples of different 1.2 SG oil-based drilling fluids and screen running fluid candidates were statically aged at 200 bar and 87 \textdegree{}C for 1 and 2 months. Complementarily characterization was performed by running viscometer sag shoe tests and laser particle size analysis of the samples. Actual core plugs of the reservoir section were selected for core flooding/formation damage tests covering different drill-in fluids and sequences including screen insertion with and without prior displacement to an actual screen running fluid. The return permeability and a detailed required draw-down analysis was performed.  Experiments have shown that the downhole stability is commonly underestimated when the surrounding pressure is lower than in the field like in a conventional aging cell. One of the drill-in fluids showed superior long-term stability with maintaining mobility even after 2 months of aging and no phase separation of significant settling. In contrast, the low-solids oil-based mud showed significant phase separation and some settling. Laboratory results were implemented to the flied by strict specification of the mud properties and verification by a comprehensive post-operational QA/QC of field samples in the laboratory.  The success was proven by no negative impact on productivity of the well compared to previously drilled and completed wells in the field. However, running the completion in DIF resulted in significant de-risking of drilling operations, cost savings and eliminated logistical challenges from previous wells.}

	abstract		= {It is known that the Stockhausen Effect, characterized as the accumulation of TVD error in directional wellbores resulting from the slide/rotate process employed with bent-housing mud motors, can have a significant impact on wellbore placement in the TVD plane. While much research has been conducted, and commercial solutions have been deployed to account for and correct these errors, all are focused on mud motor slide/rotate drilling. As contemporary drilling programs move to ever-increasing lateral lengths, utilization of Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS) is also trending upward. While potential advantages may exist in favor of RSS, like the elimination of slide drilling, it is important to consider that not all undesirable phenomena associated with slide drilling (well placement error, tortuosity, rugosity, high localized DLS, etc.) vanish from the wellbore. These characteristics are still present in the RSS wellbore and should be analyzed and quantified to ensure that wellbore quality metrics are consistent for all drilling methods.  To investigate cumulative TVD error in RSS wells, we developed a system to utilize the real time downhole steering data from RSS to populate a steering sheet that can be processed through an algorithm designed to account for TVD errors resulting from the Stockhausen effect. By capturing the RSS toolface and steering proportion in real time, we can determine at what intervals the RSS is actively steering and during what intervals it is drilling in a neutral, non-biasing mode. The result of cycling between steering and non-steering cycles creates a pattern similar to a slide/rotate sequence experienced when using steerable mud motors. This information allows us to construct a more accurate representation of the true trajectory of the wellbore than is provided by minimum curvature between the standard 95’ survey course lengths. In addition to uncovering TVD error this method also provides a higher resolution picture of various tortuosity metrics like borehole curvature and torsion.  We examined data from numerous wells across several basins to observe the TVD error generated by RSS steering mechanisms. It was concluded that these TVD errors should be considered for accurate wellbore positioning, and in addition revealed potential to enhance trajectory optimization capabilities of some Rotary Steerable Systems. In addition to uncovering TVD error, the high-resolution trajectory allows for a thorough examination of wellbore tortuosity, including localized DLS, and wellbore curvature and torsion to aid in identifying potential trouble zones in the lateral.}

	abstract		= {Occasionally, operations require setting a production liner on bottom. This could be unintentional, e.g. when the liner hanger slips fail to operate, or intentionally, e.g. when the liner is purposely run without a hanger to guarantee sufficient bypass area. A consequence of setting the liner on bottom is that the buckling force will be compressive, and assessment of the buckling severity is required to avoid high buckling induced dogleg severity (DLS). After the liner is cemented, the induced DLS is made permanent. Thus, this change in well path trajectory could jeopardize the runnability and installation of completion equipment.  In this study, the buckling induced DLS is estimated using a finite element based stiff-string model. The model takes in consideration the additional compressive loads of setting the liner top packer. It also accounts for liner centralization. It was found that this model overcomes the limitation of the theoretical models implemented in widely used commercial casing design software as it captures the physics of the buckled casing in between centralizers with more accuracy.}

	abstract		= {Offshore drilling rigs play a crucial role in global energy production, particularly in the extraction of oil and gas resources. However, the industry's environmental impact has raised concerns about the need for energy efficiency and decarbonization in offshore operations. This paper aims to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with improving energy efficiency and decarbonizing offshore drilling rigs.  The first part of the paper provides an overview of the Energy Trilemma (Sustainability, Security and Equity) followed by an introduction on the importance of data collection and analysis necessary to monitor energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions associated with offshore drilling rigs. It highlights the significant energy requirements for drilling and mobilization activities along with the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions contribute to climate change and environmental degradation, necessitating clear actions for reducing carbon footprints.  The paper highlights the economic and environmental benefits associated with energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the potential cost savings resulting from reduced energy consumption and the avoidance of carbon-related taxes or penalties. Furthermore, it reviews a 360-degree approach to Offshore Drilling Rig Decarbonization embedding it into operations, operator-contractor engagements, and technical advances. It also emphasizes the positive impact of such initiatives on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainability, and improving the industry's environmental stewardship.  Next, the paper discusses the potential strategies for enhancing energy efficiency on offshore drilling rigs. It examines advancements in optimized rig design, energy efficiency upgrades, energy storage systems and sustainable behavior enhancements. Additionally, it explores the adoption of low-carbon fuels and electrification of offshore rigs. The proven and expected benefits, challenges, and implementation considerations of these strategies are examined.  In conclusion, achieving energy efficiency and decarbonization on offshore drilling rigs is essential for addressing the Energy Trilemma while it is necessary that the drilling contractor and operator work closely together in operating the business in a way that meets economic, social, and environmental needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By embracing innovative technologies, optimizing operations, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, offshore drilling rigs can significantly reduce their carbon footprints while ensuring a sustainable and responsible future for the industry.}

	abstract		= {SPE's Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) sponsors the Drillbotics® autonomous drilling contest to promote advanced learning at participating universities. Two groups working independently employed similar engineering, software, and control technology to detect and mitigate drilling dysfunctions. Both teams demonstrated understanding of engineering requirements coupled with hands-on experience to successfully deploy their designs.  One team created a control model that connected with an industry research entity's well model that included a variety of formations and downhole pressures based on data from previously drilled wells in the North Sea. The well control simulation was new to the competition, and the team successfully created a workable system. The team drilled ahead at optimal ROP, stopping for connections. They then had to recognize an influx and determine whether this should be handled with the MPD system or stop drilling and close in on the kick. The model monitored surface flow in and flow out and pit level and compared readings with a trend analysis based on one-second data. The kick detection module included a technique to minimize false positives using a higher kick threshold, first giving a warning, and then switching from conventional drilling to MPD, and finally closing in the well if necessary. The simulated kick occurred during a connection and was a small kick at a low influx rate. It was detected when drilling, but later than desired. A retest with a lower kick threshold was more successful.  A second team designed and built a remotely operated autonomous small scale experimental rig that included a working version of an RSS tool to steer the BHA along a predefined trajectory within a block of sandstone. The control architecture enabled the distribution of various drilling tasks to independent specialized operating algorithms. Despite the limitations of a 1.5-inch wellbore, the physical rig team constructed and implemented an RSS with three pads actuated mechanically from the surface. Accompanied by an enhanced bit design and a length reduction of the BHA by over 50\% compared to the previous model, a build rate of 8 degrees was achieved in less than two feet measured depth. This effort resulted in the team's first successful application of the newly developed scaled RSS to autonomously drill a directional trajectory provided only minutes earlier. An externally applied electromagnetic field was used to measure the azimuth, while an accelerometer was used to measure the inclination to close the feedback loop for the steering algorithm.  Both teams had to solve common engineering problems, which may lead to the use of a physical rig to improve the fidelity of virtual models. Importantly, there is an increasing industry need to provide improved data interoperability, which is being met by this program. The achievements of both teams are important to the future of drilling automation, as they are first steps towards using these research tools to improve the creation of digital twins of full-scale rigs and to verify and validate interoperability of third-party apps prior to field release on land and offshore rigs.}

	abstract		= {Borehole quality is a crucial aspect of wellbore construction, impacting drilling and completion execution and long-term well reliability in terms of zonal isolation and casing integrity. However, developing key performance indicators and requirements for borehole quality has proven difficult since there are few direct measurements of borehole characteristics other than surveys.  This paper explores the use of ultra-high frequency acoustic borehole image logs and caliper measurements to develop methods to quantify effects during drilling operations, such as micro-tortuosity, salt creep, and other observed characteristics, which could prove useful in defining wellbore quality in the drilling phase. The role of the repeatable process of drilling a stand with different bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs as motorized rotary steerable systems (RSS) and conventional steerable systems (CSS) will be mapped to borehole quality impact with downhole measurements. Drilling operations and methods will be linked with the resulting borehole measurements and the relationship in terms of correlation and causality examined.  This case study documents the application of the processes and tools for vertical and lateral intervals of horizontal wells in the different basins of North America. Results of different states of drilling operations such as sliding, rotating, and reaming, drilling dysfunctions, BHA changes, drilling practices, and rock characteristics will be presented. The paper's conclusions use this approach to determine the needs and methods of wellbore quality measurement and requirements for drilling and completions and potential life of well implications.  This paper builds on the drilling mechanics process and downhole measurements to determine usable borehole quality key performance indicators that can be applied as additional wellbore quality management methods.}

	abstract		= {Drilling operations in the US Permian Basin shale play with a new 4-¾" Rotary-Steerable Drilling System (RSS) revealed that with high Rates Of Penetration (ROP), high Weight On Bit (WOB) (and other drilling parameters) encountering stringers or interbedded formations can lead to unwanted effects. The Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) can be deflected before the steering unit with its steering pads can counteract the deflection. This can lead to deviations from the directional plan and High Local Doglegs (HLD) when drilling in the horizontal/lateral section, which can have a negative impact on the electronics within the steering unit.  As a countermeasure, a combination of a pin-down connection steering unit with a short box-up connection drill bit, or Integrated Bit (IB), was developed. This combination allows a much shorter bit to steering pad distance. Due to the shorter bit-to-pad-distance an improved steering response is expected resulting in fewer high local dogleg occurrences. The integrated box-up bit basically moves the drive-shaft pin-down connection into the drill bit. The remaining bit shank is very short requiring modifications to the make-up and break-out procedure.  Results from the data acquired in the Permian Basin shale play yielded promising results in terms of steering accuracy. When comparing bending cycle load vs. local Dogleg Severity (DLS), local DLS are typically lower and have less bending cycles drilling through these critical local DLS when IB were deployed. The overall average ROP of runs with IB is higher than the overall average ROP of runs with standard bits.  The amount of data collected for this study allows a good statistical approach for comparison of the performance of a standard drilling BHA and bit versus a BHA featuring an IB. It proves that by further reducing the distance between the first formation contact point at the drill bit to the second contact point at the steering unit there is an overall improvement in performance and wellbore placement. This provides opportunities for incremental future optimization of the drill bit and BHA system.}

	abstract		= {Targeting deep reach laterals in vibration prone interbedded abrasive sandstones requires multiple bits to complete the prolific pay zones in Central USA. Excessive cutter wear coupled with extreme torque fluctuation in such targets results in reduced ROP and premature failure of BHA components. Early POOH leads to 24 to 48 hours of non-productive time due to BHA tripping. This puts huge economic risk on such challenging pay zones. This study exhibits detailed analysis of downhole and in-bit sensing data to increase the operational stability window enabling enhanced bit durability and smoother drilling conditions for economic drilling of long laterals.  The proposed bit's operation optimization framework is built using a detailed analysis for an in-bit high-frequency sensing gyro and accelerometers data correlated to the geo-steering unit vibrational and Gamma-ray data. The data analysis identified High-Frequency Torsional Oscillation (HFTO) prone formations and HFTO event frequencies, amplitudes and durations while drilling through lithologies with different rock strengths. The findings from the analysis of the field data are cross referenced to the bit response in lab experiments using in-bit sensing while drilling custom built rock cores under high confinement pressure. The result of this work is used to accurately model the drill bit performance to develop best practices to operate them. An operational stability map and a drilling guideline were built and communicated with the region for longer reach and stable drilling.  The data analysis showed a correlation between the lithology shaleness factor and the bits susceptibility to trigger HFTO among other vibrational events. The higher the shale content on the GR track the lower the HFTO excitation probability. These findings were mirrored in the lab while drilling interbedded cores at high confining pressure and it was used to calibrate our drilling models for bit optimization. The application of the drilling guidelines on operating 9 bits resulted in a total savings of \\$500K per well and 4 days less of non-productive tripping. The guided drilling practices increased the drilled footage per bit by 50\%, while reaching the same dull state as previous runs. The control of the bit HFTO and vibrational response decreased the frequency of premature BHA equipment failure enabling longer intervals and less unnecessary tripping.  The absence of wire line logging in long reach laterals limits the understanding of targeted zones. This framework enables gaining deeper formation insights that unlock the optimization of capable drill bits. The adoption of such practice is promising longer footage per bit, less downhole vibrational issues, and economic completion of challenging interbedded abrasive across the world.}

	abstract		= {High-frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a particularly damaging vibration phenomenon that occurs while drilling HFTO-prone rocks with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits and aggressive drilling parameters. Mitigation or load reduction strategies are based on weight on bit or bit rotary speed reduction and are associated with lower rate of penetration and therefore limit the drilling efficiency. This paper discusses the suppression of HFTO with a 4.75-inch tool size damper assembly that is placed above the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and typically below the mud motor. The efficiency of the damper assembly is discussed in a case study with more than 40 runs in Permian Basin targeting different applications, environments, and formations, giving further evidence that providing damping to the BHA can completely mitigate HFTO.  The damper tool is designed for the purpose of mitigating HFTO. Inputs for the design of the inertia-based damper elements are the required damping identified from high-frequency downhole measurement data, laboratory testing and modeling to analyze and optimize the damping principle incorporated in the tool, and numerical simulations to analyze the achievable damping in different BHAs. The tool design is robust as proven in a standard process of tool reliability tests including rotating bending, vibration, temperature, and pressure, and not limiting the drilling parameters. The deployment is preceded by a step that maximizes achievable damping in the deployed BHA enabled by an optimization algorithm and numerical modeling. Herein, the damper elements are optimally placed for the identified critical modes of HFTO, targeting a placement in antinodes of the mode shapes with high vibration amplitudes guaranteeing a high damping effect.  The case study incorporates more than 40 runs in NAL showing that the occurrence of HFTO is reduced significantly in different applications. The case study includes back-to-back runs with similar BHAs with and without the damper assembly in different HFTO prone applications proving the efficiency of the tool in mitigating HFTO. Consecutive runs in the same well and formation using other vibration mitigation tools show a significantly higher HFTO-suppression rate with the damper assembly. The overall performance gain by use of the damper is further proven by a statistical evaluation and in comparison to the second and third best performing vibration mitigation tool, showing significant increase in all relevant performance metrics, including, but not limited to, Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) and Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). BHAs with the new damper tools outperform BHAs with industries currently preferred commercial vibration mitigation tools by as much as +100\% in MDBF and +100\% in MTBF.  The case study shows that HFTO can be mitigated by use of the new 4.75-inch damper assembly. The damaging HFTO that held back the drilling parameters is suppressed which enables a step change in drilling efficiency and reliability, which ultimately leads to a significant decrease in drilling cost.}

	abstract		= {Standardizing well plans by utilizing Standard Practices (SPs) in the digital tools Program Builder (PrB) and Rig Site Execution (RSE) increases the competitiveness of wells operations. The process improves collaboration both within operators and with vendors, enables digitalization of data and workflows, and accelerates experiential learnings to produce more predictable outcomes. SPs are phase- or task-level operational procedures written by Franchise (Standardization) Engineers that are rig, well, and vendor agnostic which are made up of activities with operations codes, checks, and steps. SPs are categorized by Preliminary Well Designs (PWDs), and the Well Planning Report allows for definition of the sequence of SPs required for the operational plan given the PWD assigned to the well.  Once the program is initiated in PrB, the Engineer can add well, vendor, and rig specific details to the operational plan which was auto generated from SPs. The Engineer invites other collaborators, whether within the same company or a third-party, into the tool to contribute. When the draft program is ready, a review process is facilitated within PrB, and the program is assured. Next, the operational plan becomes the foundation of the work instructions, which the Supervisor owns. They enrich the program to transform it into a worksite-ready document for the wellsite staff. All edits made to the SPs are captured and become the basis of a feedback loop to continuously improve SPs. These performance improvements will naturally cascade through wells globally.  Use of Program Builder has already been demonstrated in Operations. The program was created by the Design Engineer within three weeks and was deployed to the worksite. Initial feedback from the field was strong, resulting in the decision to continue the process through work instructions. The tool was found to improve operational efficiency and drive full transparency between the office and the worksite.  Standardizing and simplifying programs reduces the administrative burden on the Engineer, allowing them to focus on higher-value aspects of the planning, and presents a single source of truth for the entire well execution process. Deriving the work instructions from the program ensures that the procedural guidance defined by Franchise through SPs is followed all the way to the worksite, leading to predictable outcomes and competitive well delivery.}

	abstract		= {Eleven (``10 + 1") mechanisms of mechanical degradation that can compromise the wellbore integrity are evaluated by modeling the stress evolutions within the casing-cement sheath-rock formation (C/CS/RF) system. Past attempts from the published literature overlooked the need for establishing an initial stress state that yields stability following cement setting (wait-on-cement). A novel approach is used to calibrate for the initial stress distributions assuming effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity along the CS's interfaces with the steel casing and the adjacent-RF.  Established analytical expressions form what is generally recognized as the basic stress analysis inside the casing walls and the RF region adjacent to a well. A calibration procedure is necessary to extend the stress model into the CS layer between the casing and the adjacent-RF considering effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity. Our mechanistic model is capable of evaluating against four failure mechanisms in the casing layer considering collapse, burst, tensile, and/or compressive stress loads, four failure mechanisms in the CS layer (inner or outer debonding, radial cracking, disking, and shear cracking), along with longitudinal and transverse tensile/"Mode I" fracture initiation in the RF layer (an "underground blowout"), and finally potential reactivation via shear-slippage of natural, pre-existing faults at close proximity, that could trigger seismic events.  Post-blowout-reservoir depletion, followed by pressurization after successful capping stack shut-in presents one of the biggest challenges vis-à-vis wellbore integrity. A case study is presented, assessing the wellbore integrity during the aftermath of the MC 252-1 "Macondo Well'' blowout from April 20, 2010, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The results differ from those of previous studies and we think are more realistic due to the improved approach used for calibrating for the initial stress distributions. Wellbore integrity is maintained during the heavy-pressure depletion that the reservoir experienced throughout the 86.2-day post-blowout-discharge period and the subsequent wellbore-pressure buildup that followed the successful well capping.}

They enable the surface MPD system to be integrated with the riser, allowing for safe and fast installation and retrieval despite complexities.  Deepwater MPD integrated riser joints are made up of (a) a below-tension-ring rotating control device (BTR-RCD) to create a seal around the drill string during the drilling and tripping process. (b) an MPD annular packer that serves as an alternative sealing device when the rotating control device (RCD) or active control device (ACD) is not deployed or needs maintenance (c) a flow spool featuring valves and tie-in points for hoses facilitating the circulation of drilling fluids from downhole to surface equipment. (d) Choke, kill and boost line conduit to interface with the rigs riser joints. The instrumentation system installed on the IRJ enables real-time wellbore pressure monitoring and remote control of MPD flow line valves. The choke, kill boost conduits as well as mux line clamp locations facilitate a normal riser set up for surface to subsea blowout preventer (BOP) communications.  IRJs that are deployed for deepwater MPD installations represent a significant advancement over the systems used in early floating rig MPD operations. They are designed for efficient and safe deployment and are compatible with a variety of deepwater drilling systems. MPD integrated riser joints operate in a complex wellbore condition allowing efficient and effective wellbore pressure control, improving the safety of deepwater drilling operations. It enables real-time monitoring of the wellbore parameters allowing drilling supervisors and engineers to make timely adjustments to drilling parameters. This technical paper reviews key design considerations of different IRJ systems developed by the industry and used in deepwater MPD operations. The paper examines how the IRJ system has evolved over time due to the requirement for a more efficient method of deploying RCD and annular isolation devices in deepwater wells.  The authors provide an unbiased view on the recent developments of Integrated Riser Joint technology based on their experience and actual application of the system worldwide.}

In the offshore fields under study, the top section typically involves drilling through formations at a range of depths with moderate inclinations. Despite the relatively straightforward technological requirements, such as using motor BHA in combination with rock bits and sea water as the base fluid, this section presents significant operational challenges.  Drilling Evolution in the Top Section Offshore Arabian GulfThe initial drilling approach in these wells, characterized by frequent total losses and execution complications, led to considerable inefficiencies. Key challenges included dealing with anti-collision risks, managing complex geophysical dynamics, and addressing issues arising from soft formation drilling, such as lack of directional control and frequent stuck pipe incidents. The use of sea water as a mud system added to these complications, particularly in deeper sections where its inability to effectively transport cuttings increased the risk of pack-offs.}

	abstract		= {Poor hole cleaning is often the cause for drilling performance deterioration, many times leading to detrimental situations such as pack-offs and stuck pipe.  In addition to high flowrate and rotational speed, lateral oscillations of the drill-string on the low-side of inclined wells were shown to improve hole cleaning. However, the drill-string lateral oscillations are usually not controlled in any way. This paper proposes a solution to trigger the lateral movement of the drill-string at certain positions, with simulation results to support the novel concept.  Generally, it is desirable to damp out drill-string vibrations as they impact drilling performance, can cause severe damage to drill-string/bottom hole assembly components, or destabilize the formation rocks. A solution based on distributed damping subs along the drill-string has been proposed to eliminate stick-slip and other forms of torsional vibrations. These damping subs utilize magnetic viscous damping through eddy current braking and their design enables active control of the damping strength. The latter fact allows to consider a coordinated control of the damping strength to initiate a controlled low amplitude lateral movement of the drill-string that can facilitate hole-cleaning while simultaneously attenuating torsional oscillations of the drill-string.  A simulated environment was used for verifying the proposed solution. It includes a transient stiff-string torque and drag model which accounts for axial, torsional and lateral displacements. The viscous damping subs are included in the model at defined locations along the drill-string. Several distributed control strategies have been simulated and the induced lateral movement of the drill-string has been analyzed. Simulations were performed with a well configuration from a field case. The first series of simulated experiments were focused on controlling the amount of viscous damping for all subs simultaneously with the same magnitude. It was observed that the effect on the lateral movement in this case was minor. In a second approach, subs placed at different locations had different damping strengths that were varied at specific time steps. Controlling the damping in a distributed fashion had a stronger effect on the local lateral movement and it was possible to create different localized movement patterns along the drill-string.  The concept of utilizing distributed damping subs along the drill-string opens the possibility to actively control the local lateral movement of the drill-pipes and therefore enhance hole cleaning performance. At the same time, torsional oscillations are damped out. Furthermore, the damping subs reduce the overall required torque at the top-drive and facilitate weight transmission to the bit.}

The primary challenge to drill 14 3/4" section in Colombia foothills is high torque values its oscillations and vibration that produce premature damage of the PDC bits; specially while drilling Carbonera C5 formation, which has a very high abrasiveness and compressive strength (25 Ksi UCS). In addition to the traditional post-drilling analysis of the bit design, the use of an advanced polygonal mesh drilling simulation software in combination with laboratory test will be described as a key element to maximize the durability of the bit. This step of the process allows for the first-time an integrated analysis of the PDC/roller cone cutting structures all together. Analysis of the engagement balance along with the calculation of forces applied to the various cutting structure components, ultimately resulting in an improved optimization of bit performance beyond the common scenario considering the use of 4-5 PDC bits for the whole section.  A computational model, using a polygonal mesh simulation was developed for getting a deeper understanding of the PDC and roller cone interaction in the cutting structure of a hybrid drill bit; afterwards, this simulation software was calibrated with data from pressurized tests obtained in a drilling lab. Improvements of the bit cutting structure started with the ability to correlate the dull condition of the bit under several conditions of torque on bit (TOB), weight on bit (WOB) distribution and Depth of Cut (DOC). This, in turn, guided the bit design changes which were then validated by running the new design through the same simulation and achieving desirable results.  The optimized hybrid drill bit sets a footage record in the Foothills area drilling 50\% further than standard PDC bits and achieving 39\% more ROP than the previous hybrid bit design in offset wells. In addition to ROP and durability improvements, the original bearing \textendash{} seal life was improved from 50\% to 100\% of effectiveness with the new design for this application in this hole size. The new design features optimized the depth of cut (DOC), the weight distribution across the cutting structure and increased stability and efficiency as well. Thus, overcoming the challenge to drill further and more efficiently through these challenging formations.  A specialized team has for the first-time optimized Roller cone structure and PDC structure together improving bottomhole drilling dynamics, performance and bit reliability for this application through the combination of robust polygonal mesh simulations of the drilling process and pressurized rock drilling tests in a drilling lab.}

Lifua is one of the marginal fields within the Block 0 concession in offshore Angola. The development plan for these marginal fields requires short-cycle and cost-effective designs to be economically feasible. Utilizing a minimum functional objective approach, Lifua-A was planned as a proof-of-concept for this strategy which involves a repeatable solution developing a standard wellhead platform design, standard well designs and a factory-repeatable platform fabrication, installation and well execution process.  The STS design was the selected solution for the development of the Lifua field. This rig-installable platform design was first developed and installed in offshore Indonesia in 1995 with slots for three wells and rated for 150 ft of water depth. Lifua-A STS is a ten-well platform with a planned installation at a water depth of 205 ft. As a result, a new enhanced STS design and installation procedure was required. As the structural design work and fabrication progressed, the technical requirements for the jack-up rig were also developed. Upon contracting the rig, detailed engineering work was undertaken to modify the rig's cantilever system to meet the lifting and installation requirements of the STS modules. The upgrade increased the rig's cantilever longitudinal skidding capability to 85 ft with a lifting capacity of 400MT. In addition, engineering work was carried out to size and install a hydraulic hammer on the rig floor to drive the 42-in. and 36-in. conductors. Finally, the laying of the subsea flexible production flowline, thermoplastic composite water injection pipeline, and subsea power cable were all engineered in a way where they could be pulled in and up the STS platform from the rig floor utilizing a drillpipe-sling assembly and a winch cable.  The installation of the Lifua-A STS was executed according to plan, achieving the short-cycle objective by delivering the project within three years from FID to first oil. In addition, the project planning and execution was successfully carried out during the COVID pandemic. One key success factor was having the cross-functional groups working together as one team, from the development of the design to fabricating the structures and actual offshore installation. Lifua-A unlocked the marginal reserves of the Lifua field by stretching the limit of the application of the STS. This success opens the possibility of utilizing the same solution to other similar marginal fields.}

Casing cut and pull is alone responsible for approximately 50\% of the cost to establish a formation-formation barrier. However, if the settled barite in the annulus can be used as an additional barrier element, P\\\&A operations can be simplified, and the cost reduced. With this in mind, it is therefore necessary to investigate the sealing and mechanical properties of settled barite. In this study, settled barite from a field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is investigated to understand the mechanical and sealing properties of the settled and compacted barite from the wellbore and to compare them with cement properties. Strength and ultrasonic measurements are carried out on cored samples to assess their mechanical properties. Computed Tomography scans give an overview of the sample’s texture, and the Scanning electron microscopy provides insight on the microstructure and changes in the chemical composition of the barite from the oil well. In addition, the cohesion (or resistance to mobilisation) of barite powder is assessed by direct shear strength under various loads using a rheo-powder cell. We start by measuring the mechanical properties of settled and compacted barite, which are relatively similar in all samples. Then, compared with typical cement G, settled barite presents low stiffness and mechanical strength. Finally, we compared the mechanical properties of settled barite powders from the field with those of unused sample from the laboratory. In both cases, the barite powder exhibits low flowability, i.e., it is extremely difficult to mobilize, and this increases with humidity. In this paper, new results on the assessment of settled barite as a barrier material are reported through various mechanical, ultrasonic, and imaging tests of a realistic settled and compacted barite from an oil field and compared to an oil well cement. In this case, we observed that the settled barite has poor mechanical properties for potential use as an additional barrier element. This could be link to the original formulation of the drilling fluids used and the conditions of use in the well.}

	abstract		= {Torsional stick-slip vibrations are a significant cause of drill string damage and failure. Using damping subs distributed along the drill string has been demonstrated in both simulations and laboratory experiments as a viable solution to reduce stick-slip in drilling. The effectiveness in mitigating stick-slip can be further improved through active control of the damping strength of one or several subs. This paper evaluates a control scheme, which relies only on local downhole measurements, for various operating conditions simulated with a drill string mechanics model. Damping subs with sleeves supported on bearings and incorporated eddy current brakes are installed along the drill string, adding viscous damping to the system to mitigate torsional vibrations. The damping amount is proportional to the relative rotational speed between the sleeve and the pipe, and therefore maximized when the sleeves are non-rotating. However, if the braking force surpasses the static friction holding the sleeve in place, the sleeve slips and reduces its braking abilities. To counteract this, an On-Off-based control scheme with proportional control (P-Off controller) is implemented at the level of each sub to manipulate the value of its damping coefficient. The Off condition is triggered when local measurements indicate slipping of the sleeve. Simulations of various drilling scenarios conducted with a coupled axial and torsional drill string model show that the P-Off controller can reduce stick-slip in the system in both off-bottom and on-bottom conditions. The results indicate that the average damping coefficient, and implicitly the torque added to the system, can be greatly reduced compared to a passive damping system, consisting of the same number and positioning of subs but with constant damping coefficients. Also, the settling time of the downhole rotational speed is significantly reduced compared to the passive system. The control scheme is decentralized as it relies only on local knowledge, such as pipe rotational speed inferred from an inertial measurement unit, to estimate the top drive revolutions per minute (RPM) setpoint. Therefore, communication with the surface or with neighboring subs is not a requirement for the control implementation. The controller also shows robustness against variations in the top drive RPM and noisy downhole measurements, which is important for a real-world application. The presented approach differs from existing downhole torsional vibration damping solutions, as it does not rely on a single tool placed inside or near the bottom-hole assembly, but on several subs distributed along the drill string, with their damping strength adjusted directly downhole in a decentralized manner.}

	abstract		= {Annular shale creep barriers which can guarantee long-term well integrity over the entire lifespan of the well can be stimulated by temperature elevation caused by artificial heating inside the wellbore. Prior work has shown that heating can significantly accelerate barrier formation, but may also damage the shale formation if certain temperatures are applied. This paper reports on the optimum thermal conditions for shale barrier formation based on extensive new laboratory as well as literature data.  Thermally accelerated creep behavior was studied for the Lark and the Shetland North Sea shales. Large-scale triaxial equipment was used to study the behavior of shales under downhole stress and pressure conditions while varying temperature. In addition, an extensive literature study investigated the thermal effect of shales used for nuclear containment, such as the Boom Clay in Belgium, Cox Shale in France, and Opalinus Clay in Switzerland. The investigation focused on the impacts of temperature elevation on important shale properties such as creep rate, sealing and self-healing ability, and temperature-induced porosity, permeability, and mineralogical changes.  Both the laboratory investigation and the literature study showed that there is an optimum range for artificial thermal stimulation of shale barriers, with an upper temperature of 200°C \textendash{} 300\textdegree{}C that should not be exceeded. At lower temperatures, thermal pore fluid expansion may lead to effective stress reduction and shear failure on shale bedding planes. In the optimum range, fluid thermal expansion is effectively negated by thermally-induced shale consolidation, and barrier formation is optimally accelerated, which is of great practical value for field implementations. Above the optimum range, irreversible dehydration and metamorphosis of the clay constituent of the shale happen and the shale loses its ability to creep to form a barrier and self-heal. This important result shows that heating inside wellbores to improve/accelerate creep of shales needs to be a controlled, engineered process in order to yield a competent barrier. This favors the use of a temperature-controlled heater rather than a less-controllable exothermic reaction.  Shale barriers seal annuli much better and more reliably than cement barriers. Moreover, their self-healing ability offers the ability to guarantee annular well integrity for an indefinite period, including the P\\\&A phase. Thermal stimulation is preferred by operators to accelerate barrier formation without requiring annular access. The findings of this paper provide important theoretical and practical guidance on how to optimally stimulate shale barriers and avoid pitfalls associated with thermally-induced shale damage.}

	abstract		= {Well integrity issues have been widely studied in the oil and gas sector; however, with storage wells (e.g. towards natural gas, CO2 and H2), new challenges may arise due to the reactivity of the stored fluid in contact with well barrier materials, including migration and leakage of fluids. It is therefore essential to study the reaction of fluids with cement in well conditions to be able to predict the evolution of the cement annulus when exposed to fluids.  We have performed fluid flow experiments through realistic cracks in an annular cement sheath in a downscaled wellbore section. Two different experimental procedures to measure fluid flow have been investigated. The setup consists of a steel casing, cement sheath and surrounding rock. This setup provides a unique possibility to perform pressure cycling experiments to investigate cement sheath integrity and subsequent flow measurement across the 30—cm long cement sheath.  We compare the evolution of the flow rate of both gas (N2) and brine (liquid). Fluid flow testing with N2 and brine provides a reference measurement of the micro annuli permeability for both liquid and gas phases. As nitrogen does not react with cement, it provides a reference flow measurement. This paper reports initial and new results, measuring fluid flow as a function of inner casing pressure of a downscaled wellbore section.}

	abstract		= {A new LWD sensor is introduced for measuring a high-resolution borehole image in large boreholes and both in light and heavy oil base mud. The new sensor uses advanced radar technology, and in addition to caliper (time-of-flight) image, delivers an electrical image to help geoscientists visualize and understand the stratigraphy and fractures.  A pulse radar operating in the multi-gigahertz range is implemented within the bottom hole assembly. As the BHA rotates, the radar measurements scan the borehole surface. The time of flight is converted to a distance to the borehole wall. The amplitude of the reflected signal correlates with the micro-resistivity/permittivity of the formation in the immediate vicinity of the borehole.  Up until recently, sensors capable of performing these caliper measurements while drilling have been limited to smaller size boreholes and lighter muds. A new technology, based on a downhole radar rotating with the bottom hole assembly extends the application to boreholes of 18 inches and more in oil base mud. The same technology yields a micro-resistivity/permittivity image that is prized by the geoscientists for recognizing key geological features, including layered formations, fractures, faults, and unconformities. Here again the new technology is the first to our knowledge to obtain such information while drilling in large holes and light and heavy oil base mud.  A new technology, namely the downhole pulsed GHz radar brings a new solution to well-known problems. High resolution calipers and micro-resistivity images while drilling have been made available to the industry in recent years, however they are restricted to smaller than 12 ¼`` boreholes and water base mud. The article below explains how and how well the new technology has significantly increased the range of applicability to oil base mud for large hole sizes, like 12 \textonequarter{}" and 17-1/2''.}

	abstract		= {Finding information across multiple databases, formats, and documents remains a manual job in the drilling industry. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in data-aggregation tasks, including answering questions. However, using LLMs for domain-specific factual responses poses a nontrivial challenge. The expert labor cost for training domain-specific LLMs prohibits niche industries from developing custom question-answering bots. This paper tests several commercial LLMs for information retrieval tasks for drilling data using zero-shot in-context learning. In addition, we studied the model’s calibration using a few-shot multiple-choice drilling questionnaire.  To create an LLM benchmark for drilling, we collated the text data from publicly available databases: the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), company annual reports, and petroleum glossary. We used a zero-shot learning technique that relies on an LLM’s ability to generate responses for tasks outside its training. We implemented a controlled zero-shot learning ``in-context'' procedure that sends a user’s query augmented with text data to the LLM as inputs. This implementation encourages the LLM to take the answer from the data while leveraging its pre-trained contextual-learning capability.  We evaluated several state-of-the-art generic LLMs available through an API, including G4, G3.5-TI, J2-ultra model, and L2 series. The paper documents the pre-trained LLMs’ ability to provide correct answers and identify petroleum industry jargon from the collated dataset. Our zero-shot in-context learning implementation helps vanilla LLMs provide relevant factual responses for the drilling domain. While each LLM’s performance varies, we have identified models suitable for a drilling chatbot application. In particular, G4 outperformed on all the tasks. This finding suggests that training expensive domain-specific LLMs is not necessary for question-answering tasks in the context of drilling data.  We demonstrate the utility of zero-shot in-context learning using pre-trained LLMs for question-answering tasks relevant to the drilling industry. Additionally, we prepared and publicly released the collated datasets from the NPD database and companies’ annual reports to enable results reproducibility and to foster acceleration of language model adoption and development for the subsurface and drilling industries. The petroleum industry may find our solution beneficial for enhancing personnel training and career development. It also offers a method for conducting data analytics and overcoming challenges in retrieving historical well data.}

	abstract		= {In this paper we make the case that data science captures value in well construction when data analysis methods, such as machine learning, are underpinned by first principles derived from physics and engineering and supported by deep domain expertise.  Despite receiving wide attention in recent years, many organizations currently struggle to derive value from their data science efforts. In our experience, disappointment arises for a multitude of reasons, which we discuss in detail. Key issues that often hinder value capture include poor data management, challenges in working with WITSML data, lack of well construction domain expertise by data science teams, inadequate use of physics and engineering and failure to adopt data science solutions into existing or new well construction workflows.  Although by no means comprehensive, we provide a summary of important data that pertains to the well construction process. We further discuss high-level areas where data science can add value to well construction through analysis of such data. Data science initiatives typically fit within at least one of the following categories: Historical Studies, Well Planning, Real-Time Well Construction Execution and Post-Drill Learning Capture. Historical studies are often good places for data science teams to initially focus their efforts. However, as insights are drawn and potential for value is shown, organizations should consider extending capabilities developed to carry-out historical studies to support well planning and real-time well construction execution workflows.  A large portion of this paper is dedicated to discussing ways that organizations can work to improve their abilities to derive value from data science efforts. Most of the discussion focuses on steps that data science teams can take today. However, our commentary on data management and governance is more forward looking. Important topics which we cover include:Data management and governance.  Serving data to data scientists.  Working with WITSML data.  Basic skills and technologies needed by data science teams.  Importance of building common capabilities for working with data.  Need for physics and engineering to inform data analysis.  Importance of identifying data quality issues.  Importance of activity-based data filtering when working with WITSML data.  Dysfunction detection using WITSML data.  Application of statistics and machine learning.  We conclude by examining several historical data science case studies for well construction. Each example highlights the need to connect data and some physical or engineering process (i.e., ``engineering with data'') to deliver value through data science.}

This study looks to quantify the effect other parameters such as fluid loss additive concentration, fluid loss additive type (ie: film former, particle bridging or water viscosifier), foam quality and temperature have on the foamed fluid loss performance.  Base foam cement slurries were designed with in the density range of 16.6-16.8 ppg. Static fluid loss testing was conducted on all slurry designs without foaming. The slurries were conditioned in an HPHT consistometer at either 50, 66 or 90 °F and 6250 psi prior to conducting static fluid loss testing. Two fluid loss values for the base slurry designs were targeted (approx. 100 and 200 mL API) to quantify the effect fluid loss additive concentration has on foamed fluid loss performance. The designs were then foamed to foam qualities of 10\% and 40\% in a Multiple Analysis Cement System (MACS) analyzer and conditioned for 30 minutes before being transferred to a foamed fluid loss cell and tested.  The control slurry with no fluid loss additive was tested at 66 \textdegree{}F and foamed to a 10\% and 40\% foam quality. There was a significant decrease in fluid loss after foaming with an almost 86\% reduction in fluid loss versus the uncontrolled blowout value obtained by the base design. In the absence of fluid loss additive in the slurry, the fluid loss values showed improvement with increasing foam quality. The slurries containing a fluid loss additive showed the same reduction in fluid loss once foamed but didn’t show a significant change in fluid loss between the 10\% foam quality to the 40\% foam quality. The trend was the same for the slurries that started with an approximately 200 mL and 100 mL fluid loss. Both saw reductions when foaming but no significant change between foam quality values. An increase in slurry temperature generally produced lower fluid loss values once foamed.  Foamed fluid loss was performed and compared between slurries with and without a fluid loss additive present. Some of the slurries with fluid loss additives didn’t have fluid loss performance that correlated to foam quality. Two of the tested fluid loss additives showed a strong synergy with foaming to reduce the fluid loss. In comparison, the slurry without any fluid loss additives had fluid loss performance directly correlated to foam quality presenting some operational complexity.}

	abstract		= {The past few years have seen many experienced drilling operations personnel retire. Coincidently, the industry saw an increase in the number of drillstring failures, some of which could have potentially been avoided. These failures can result in non-productive time (NPT) like fishing trips, side tracking, or exorbitant repair bills, all of which can be costly. The consequence of these failures can be steep, and the objective of this paper is to assist with recognition and prevention of these failures. The number and type of field failures allow us to identify areas of neglect in which shared best practices may have been forgotten or not passed on. A renewed advocation of these essential drillstring running practices will help to mitigate issues before they cause operation disruption and budget overage.  In identifying issues, our intent is to recognize observed variances in running and handling practices that have potential to add complications to well construction, exacerbate budgets, and/or possibly create unsafe working environments. The solutions presented are based on actual field cases and have proven effective. More than ever, variances in best operational practices when running the string have immediate or long-term consequences. Whether the task is slips setting, connection makeup or breakout, elevator positioning, thread compound application, etc., all operations can be poorly executed when adequate information/education is not shared/passed on. As a result, over-torquing (uncontrolled down hole make-up) or, on the flipside, loosening of connections (reactive torque) is far too common and is intensified by the increase of laterals lengths.  One cannot ignore our industry's extreme drive on operation efficiency and cost reduction. Unfortunately, ignoring best practices or minimizing proven steps can be counterproductive, especially in today's more complex wellbore trajectories and demanding drilling programs. The expected outcome of this paper is to identify poor procedural conduct, explain consequences of the same, and inform drilling operations personnel with operational alternatives that will yield results. Explaining the importance and value of these best practices can renew an industry culture driven by safety and performance. Knowing and, more importantly, understanding why procedures require improvement will promote a virtuous behavior. This includes understanding the touch points and critical interfaces that the string has with the rig surface pipe handling equipment, in particular the iron roughneck and the top drive.}

	abstract		= {This study presents a groundbreaking methodology aimed at achieving optimal precision in estimating the orientation of hole bottoms—a critical factor for the success of Directional Drilling (DD) operations. This process plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs by integrating measurements from the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) and Rotary Steerable System (RSS). By combining these multiple data sources, a comprehensive perspective of drill bit orientation is obtained, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of individual measurement methods.  The process involves assessing the current bit orientation in relation to the initial plan through RSS measurements and merging it with continuous MWD measurements, tendency estimation, and automated steering mode detection. By integrating these different elements, the process overcomes occasional low azimuth measurement precision associated with RSS due to magnetic interference.  The application of this methodology has yielded substantial improvements in accurately determining hole bottom orientation, achieving an impressive 80\% reduction in RMSE compared to conventional measurements. These results establish the methodology as a robust tool in the field of DD. Its successful implementation in drilling operations across diverse geographical locations, including North and South America, the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe, serves as a testament to its potential for widespread adoption. Notably, this methodology has been deployed in 13 different countries.  From a business standpoint, this breakthrough carries significant implications, as it serves as a pivotal digital enabler for reducing personnel requirements in directional drilling and enabling fully remote operations. Consequently, it has the potential to revolutionize the sector.  Beyond enhancing drilling efficiency and reducing operational costs, the solution offered in this study contributes substantially to sustainable well construction. This is accomplished by minimizing resource utilization and energy consumption through precise hole bottom orientation, reducing carbon emissions through remote operations, and extending well lifespans through increased drilling accuracy. The anticipated integration of real-time gyro measurements holds promise for further enhancing operational precision, thereby minimizing waste, and reducing environmental impact.  In conclusion, this transformative approach to hole bottom orientation in drilling operations holds tremendous promise for the future of Autonomous Directional Drilling, with the potential to redefine operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability within the sector.}

	abstract		= {Plug and abandonment activity is expected to increase and remain an active service as wells need to be permanently abandoned and/or enable slot recovery. Throughout the life of a well, degradation of the mud system in the annulus can lead to migration of mud solids, which settle at areas of high deviation or increased dogleg severity or at above the top of the cement. In this process strong engineering model is needed in addition to the logging runs to maximize the length of the cut casings, to establish higher accuracy to estimate the cutting depth. Increased reliability for Cut and Pull in a single cut/trip is needed so that it provides safety to avoid flowing fluids to mitigate barrier breakdown. Cut and pull the casing pipe conditions require fast and accurate response. This paper describes an analytical model through which drag calculations are modified to determine: the force at the deepest cut point within the given limits of the pipe conditions; the measured weight or overpull within the margin required to pull; the measured weight required pull at any depth. The total drag is the sum of the mechanical frictional forces acting on the casing during the pull operation and the fluid frictional forces due to the fluid contact with the inside and outside of the casing. In addition, any solids packed around the casing will exert a frictional force with the outside of the casing. Kinetic friction and shear force required to break the bonding are also included. The percentage of solids and sediments and length of the contaminants are estimated through logs.}

	abstract		= {This paper aims to track and predict the best way to run the casing string while the specific hole segment of the well is drilled. Several variables with estimated indications are monitored in real-time, and a comprehensive index is used to measure the runnability of the casing. An evaluation of whether the casing can be run without a short landing is provided by the approach created by combining geometrical and mechanical parameter calculations. This gives the opportunity to make more modifications while the well is being drilled.  Generally speaking, the borehole quality used to run the casing has an impact on the ``smoothness'' that links the wellbore geometry and mechanical system used to drill the portion of the well. It is feasible to determine the runnability of the casing for a particular hole size using complex equations represented with common sense and real-time drilling parameters. Wellbore tortuosity, borehole torsion, wellprofile energy, casing push through force, margin of slackoff force, and overpull margin all work together to facilitate the assessment of a suggested wellpath in order to ascertain the runnability of the casing. For operations like running casing in curve building sections or to total depth on lengthy laterals, combining operational experience and trajectory parameters in a methodology has shown to be an effective way to estimate operational risk. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which the runnability metrics can be adjusted in realtime with actual drilling and survey details. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which runnability measurements can be used to predict or identify other difficulties, such as intricate stimulation tasks, artificial lift functionality, and potential well servicing issues that could result from undesired curvature, borehole torsion, and wellbore drift.}

	abstract		= {In a pioneering collaboration, a major rig contractor and a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider have jointly created an innovative solution for closed-loop drilling automation. The primary focus of this technology is to achieve cost reduction per foot of drilling by employing a Machine-Learning (ML) based rate of penetration (ROP) optimizer while reducing dysfunctions. This optimizer enables remote control of rig site auto driller setpoints through a seamless cloud-to-cloud connection, without the need for any additional rig devices.  The ML ROP optimizer has been previously published in SPE publications by the SaaS provider, with references (SPE-212568-MS, SPE-208751-MS, SPE-204043-MS, SPE-URTEC-343). A rig contractor developed an Application Programming Interface (API) to receive control setpoints - weight on bit (WOB), ROP, revolutions per minute (RPM), and differential pressure (DPRES) from the optimizer. These setpoints are synchronized between cloud and edge, then to the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), ensuring reliable connection via a heartbeat mechanism. An enhanced auto driller system was deployed to improve setpoint control. Field testing involved a three-well campaign in the Permian Basin, targeting lateral sections in two formations in collaboration with a major Oil and Gas Operator.  Several key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed to evaluate the performance of the automation technology against conventional manual drilling. In Test Well 1, 52\% of lateral footage was drilled with the automation technology enabled, resulting in a 13\% improvement in ROP and successful completion of the lateral in a single bit trip. For Test Wells 2 and 3, the percentage of lateral footage drilled with the automation technology was 56\% and 48\%, respectively. On-bottom ROP was improved by 25\% on average after filtering out control drilling for rotary steerable system (RSS) downlinks. For both Test Wells 2 and 3, no unplanned trip occurred.  To mitigate the impact of high vibration during drilling, the vibration filter feature was activated for Test Well 3. This feature avoided sending setpoints that were correlated with recent high vibration. This automated mitigation approach effectively reduced vibration without requiring manual intervention. The remote control of setpoints significantly minimized the need for manual intervention, reducing driller fatigue and allowing them to focus on other critical tasks for ensuring safe drilling operations. The paper will present detailed data supporting the observations.  This paper presents an innovative integration of ML and cloud technologies, achieving real-time control of auto-driller setpoints without the need for additional edge devices on the rig. The seamless cloud connection enables scalable and remote deployment of AI and drilling automation, leading to optimized operations and cost reduction. The collaboration between an operator, rig contractor, and SaaS company sets a pioneering example of closed-loop drilling automation.}

	abstract		= {Advances in the properties of OPC and new materials (i.e., mechanical strength, rheological properties, etc.) have shifted the R\\\&D focus towards sealing capability of plugging materials at interfaces between the material and its adjacent medium. The objective of this paper is to outline the importance of new standards for studying hydraulic sealability of barrier materials, with emphasis on interface analysis. This work reviews different procedures used to study hydraulic sealability of barrier materials. Reviewing current standards and procedures for testing and qualifying zonal isolation materials indicates that the focus is mainly on the bulk properties of cement, such as expansion/shrinkage, permeability, and mechanical strength. The benefits of these standards are to provide reproducible results, consistent testing procedures and prevent misunderstandings about behavior of hardened cement in laboratory and field operations. However, interfaces are complex and cannot be tested with current standards, meaning that mechanical properties alone cannot indicate hydraulic sealability. The review process also includes non-setting materials further indicating the need for updated standards.  Per today, there is published work on sealability testing on the barrier material interfaces, either towards the surrounding rock or towards the casing. This is of particular importance due to more emerging well types such as CCS, hydrogen storage, geothermal wells, and purpose based well integrity and plug and abandonment. A thorough review of sealability test setups indicates that different research groups have designed setups with similar features, but with variations on scale dimensions, testing protocol and so on. This, in combination with the availability of modern measurement technologies, offers the possibility of enhanced understanding of barrier sealability. As no standards currently describe a uniform testing procedure, direct comparison of results is thus inaccurate, putting the reproducibility and reliability of analyses at risk. Our observation shows that possible considerations for standardization include understanding the effect of dimensional scales, the sequence in the procedure, the duration of testing, the type of casing steel or rock, and the type of invasion fluid besides the amount of released heat of setting material. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that current standards are updated to include sealability analysis, and updates for new and alternative materials, such as geopolymers, settled barite, and metal alloys.}

	abstract		= {Effective management of asset retirement obligations is a paramount objective for operators in the oil and gas industry. As the industry undergoes significant shifts in focus towards environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance, ensuring the efficient and thorough decommissioning of wells and the permanent sealing of potential reservoirs during plug and abandonment (P\\\&A) procedures has become imperative. Operators seek additional assurances both before and during the P\\\&A process to confirm the integrity of cement barriers and plugs, as well as the overall effectiveness of containment measures. (G. Ishmukhametova,2017)In the pursuit of achieving long-term integrity in well abandonment while optimizing the utilization of limited rig resources, operators must grasp the intricacies of potential flow paths. This knowledge is critical for the strategic placement of the most effective barriers to prevent any future environmental or safety risks associated with well abandonment.  One of the primary challenges in well abandonment is the possibility of annulus pressure or fluid flow at the surface resulting from barrier failures. While surface diagnostic techniques such as flow checks and gas or fluid sampling can provide valuable insights into the origins of leaks, they often fall short in precisely identifying the source and leak path with complete certainty. In most cases, this ambiguity hampers traditional methods for re-establishing cement barriers, such as cement squeezing, section milling, or casing expansion.}

	abstract		= {As operators actively manage their costs of drilling, reducing cost in one area can increase it in another. Millions of horizontal feet drilled across North American shale basins has effectively eradicated existing drill pipe fleets. In addition, the rise of 5-1/2 inch variants in land-based Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells has made drill pipe more difficult and costly to replace, so keeping drill pipe in service for as long as possible is paramount to improving its total cost of ownership as well as to ameliorate the risk of replacement when supply chains preclude availability. In two continuous trials, drill pipe was protected using welded wear bands near the center of the tubes, with the downhole effect on the pipe carefully measured and analyzed.  Using a ground-breaking, low heat input welding process, protective weld material was applied to drill pipe tube bodies used in the Jonah Field and Midland Basin. These protected the most vulnerable areas of the tubes from wear and mitigated DBR/downgrade. The protected drill pipe was thoroughly inspected after being used in both the Jonah Field and Midland Basin, and relevant technical inputs were recorded for every run in the Jonah Field. Extensive measurements were taken of the wear bands run-over-run to evaluate their effectiveness throughout the trials.  The technical need for protected drill pipe was twofold, effective rock destruction when drilling through hard, abrasive sandstone coupled with the economic need to deliver 2-2.5-mile laterals. For the trials, inspections – including dimensional, visual, Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI), and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) \textendash{} were completed on pipe following multiple lateral runs and wells. These data were used to measure and monitor material loss of both the wear bands and drill pipe body and indicated that the wear bands were effectively protecting the drill pipe while wearing at measurable rates. Revolutions, calculated side forces, and lithology were tracked on a run-to-run basis in the Jonah Field to assist with normalizing the measured wear rates and evaluating the effectiveness of the trial wear bands. All this revealed successful runs with the wear bands present.  The value of this improved welding method is that it extends the life of the drill pipe, significantly decreasing the total cost of ownership for operators. Although these trials were limited in scope, a meaningful ROI will be achieved at scale, with all or most of the drill pipe protected with the longest-lasting wear bands. Because the wear bands cost less than 25\% of a new joint of pipe and allow the pipe to last up to twice as long, this Return On Investment (ROI) is substantial.}

	abstract		= {The drilling and completion of oil and gas wells is a collaborative business, involving employees from many contractors working together. Well construction generates many documents that are shared cross-functionally between these different groups. A regulator may receive an as-drilled plat from a well planner, using surveys from an MWD operator, based on a pipe tally from a rig contractor. In this scenario, the person legally specifying the well location has likely never physically seen the wellhead or the equipment used to define the location. The regulatory database might later be used by a different operator for identifying offset wells on a nearby drilling program, further confounding matters. While document sharing is critical for successful well construction, there is often little opportunity for verification before use or transmission to another party.  A review of documents related to well construction was performed. This included plats, well plans, bottom hole assembly reports, directional surveys, and other drilling records. The examination was performed on which data was contained in these documents, how it might be verified by a third party using it, and the potential for errors to arise when the data is received or transmitted. Of particular concern were documents such as well locations and directional surveys which are not only difficult to verify but are also likely to be further shared with additional parties. These documents are frequently the basis for critical decisions related to well construction, implying a strong potential for erroneous data to be used when making those decisions.  For most of the document types investigated, there was little to no standardization on the content or format of the data presented. Similarly, when documents contained redundant data (such as a well name across a directional survey record, bottom hole assembly reports, and well plans) there was often inconsistency in how that data was presented. While in many cases the accuracy of the data may still be unverifiable, several good practices for identifying gross errors in documentation and preventing erroneous data from entering a curated database are presented. Examples include ensuring personnel are trained in the significance of the data being received and requesting redundant data whenever possible so internal cross-validation can be performed for data consistency.  Data quality processes for internal workflows have long been a focus for the industry. As more systems become increasingly connected, a similar amount of attention must be paid to external workflows, where if care is not taken data of unknown and unverifiable quality may be used to make critical decisions.}
