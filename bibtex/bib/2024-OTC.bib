	abstract		= {Deepwater Emergency Pipeline Repair Systems (EPRS) are a suite of dedicated equipment manufactured, tested, and stored for the full life of the pipeline(s) in readiness to quickly perform a repair in the event of damage to the pipeline occurring. The requirement, design, manufacture, and storage of these systems carry Commercial and Technical challenges.  An overview of an EPRS will first be provided, followed by a review of the associated Commercial Challenges. Following this an outline of the Technical Challenges and Technical Drivers (decisions made by the design team which drive the direction of the system design) are discussed. Finally, three pipeline repair system case studies will be presented.  The requirement for an EPRS can range from it being a legislative requirement, a governmental license requirement, a commercial, reputational and environmental consideration, a requirement of the pipeline operators insurers, all focused on limiting loss of oil and gas transport volume should a breach of pipeline integrity occur. Considerations are often aided by detailed Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies and can be supported by a pipeline operator consortium to share costs in a given geographical region.  The Technical Challenges are external factors, generally fixed parameters such as pipeline diameter, operating pressure or environment, and are not readily influenced by the EPRS designer. The EPRS Technical Drivers must accommodate all aspects of the pipelines performance envelope, but can be delivered by a range of different solutions optimised, technically and commercially, to fulfilling the specified scope. These drivers will be described further in this paper along with respective, technical, and commercial options.  This paper addresses three EPRS solutions that have been built: one deployed in West Africa, one currently stored in North West Australia in readiness for a repair and one built and tested for the Black Sea region.  This overview of the key challenges associated with a repair system, and how these have been solved on the three EPRS case studies, will provide valuable information to pipeline operators considering a Deepwater EPRS solution.}

	abstract		= {The concept of digital twin has evolved over the years, from a product-oriented approach to an asset-oriented one. However, this shift in scope has also brought challenges and confusion for owners and stakeholders, who may have different expectations and requirements for a digital representation of their physical assets. In this paper, we propose the term 'digital avatar' to describe a digital asset that enhances the capabilities of a real asset, rather than replicating it. The ‘Digital Avatar’ can be seen as a digital extension of the asset, providing additional capabilities and insights that cannot be available in the physical realm.  Based on our experience and ongoing digital products, we constructed a framework to summarize the foundational technologies and concepts behind implementing a ‘digital avatar’ for an Oil and Gas production facility. These technologies have been categorized according to their purpose and laid out on an implementation timeline for greenfield projects. The main products we used as reference to build the Framework are also briefly presented to illustrate how this framework can support design, asset lifecycle management and performance optimization. This framework can help owners and stakeholders to align their objectives and priorities for developing and implementing digital avatars, as well as to evaluate their benefits and limitations.}

	abstract		= {Floating wind energy is a very promising source of energy, with governments across the globe embarking on ambitious plans to tap into wind energy offshore over the coming decades. There are clear advantages of offshore wind over onshore, such as higher sustained wind speeds and more locations for new developments, including deep water (i.e., water depths exceeding 200 ft). We performed a concept development study and preliminary analysis to test the feasibility of a proposed floating offshore wind spar concept using an innovative steel-concrete-steel ``sandwich'' composite system, with emphasis on efficient, cost-effective fabrication for a low Capital Expenditure (CapEx). This type of composite modular system has been successfully utilized and implemented into both safety-related nuclear facilities for use as containment structures and multi-story commercial structures as lateral force resisting core walls. We developed our spar concept design considering properties of the 5 MW and 15 MW NREL wind turbine available in public domain. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an innovative construction method to lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) support structures by utilizing local resources and existing infrastructure. This approach allows for modular and horizontal fabrication and assembly of a hull system that utilizes exterior steel ``face'' plates that act as permanent formwork and reinforcing steel to an inner concrete core \textendash{} where the faceplates are anchored to the concrete using steel anchors (shear studs or similar) and to each other using steel ties (round bar being the most common type of tie) that are typically welded to the faceplates. The resulting structure behaves similarly to proven concrete spar designs but can be constructed in a more expedited and more economical way compared to any other hull system capable of supporting large wind turbines and associated infrastructure. A steel-plate composite (or SC) construction methodology for spar hulls has several advantages compared to traditional hull construction, with one of the key benefits being an accelerated construction timeline due to being able to fabricate individual steel sub-modules in a controlled environment. These sub-modules are then interconnected into larger steel modules in a planned sequence horizontally over the length of the spar, with concrete placement occurring as the larger steel modules are completed. Similar concrete spar structures are typically built in a vertical arrangement using labor intensive and time-consuming slip forming methodologies requiring specialized dry dock facilities. An SC spar system constructed as described would also be better suited for local (North American) port infrastructure and shipyards to be able to fabricate and assemble. In our study, we ran preliminary calculations using first principles to estimate the dimensions and weights of the SC spar system. Once detailed sizing analysis of the platform is performed, design parameters such as wall thickness and weight can be further optimized. Additional studies and testing shall be performed at a later stage to improve the maturity of this concept.}

	abstract		= {This paper is a critical review of the application of the apposite brownfield total equipment care (TEC) principles and concepts largely contributory to the higher rotating equipment reliability and availability figures in the Bonga Deepwater operation. The approach defines how the performance of an ageing fleet of rotating machinery susceptible to myriads of production challenges including changing production fluids chemistry, reservoir pressure decline, equipment obsolescence and reliability reduction of ancillary equipment, supply chain disruptions effect of COVID \textendash{} 19 and its aftermath and others has been unlocked in a cost-effective manner to support the bottom-line business aspirations and achieve 1 billion barrels milestone. This paper is one of a series of Bonga themed papers proposed for OTC 2024.  The Bonga field journey to One Billion Barrels started with the launch of the Bonga Business Improvement Plan (BBIP) in 2016 with keen focus on improving on four (4) critical systems per year through End-to-End system reliability improvement, Asset register update, Reliability centered maintenance, Critical Sparing reviews, Surveillance refresh and Preventive Maintenance Optimization. Key strategies deployed are: Embedding Proactive Technical Monitoring (PTM) to aid in early identification and mitigation of threats prior to becoming big issues, by leveraging on technology tools such as Exception Based Surveillance (EBS), SmartConnect, Plant Information, Solar InSight, and System-1 amongst others, Deepening Failure Investigations by deploying Causal Reasoning methodology across business (including HSSE type events) to understand root causes and systemic issues, and driving Maintenance Efficiency, capacity \& capability building through strong collaboration with major rotating equipment manufacturers during planning and execution of major overhauls, utilizing onsite workshop and corporate workshop onshore for major maintenance activities not limited to valve overhauls, electric motor repairs, and pumps, and improved execution strategies resulting in optimized maintenance costs.  With our Proactive Threat Management approach, daily surveillance, strong collaboration with equipment OEMs during planning of major equipment overhauls, improved execution strategies and execution efficiencies, Bonga FPSO have been able to achieve significant improvement in plant availability of \\&gt;95\%, reliability \\&gt;96\%, and significant reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions through reduction of flares and fuel emissions, which has overall contributed to the 1 billion barrels export milestone achieved.  This paper presents the benefit of digitalization, robust Asset Management processes and competence development as key enablers to improved plant and equipment Reliability, Availability \& Utilization in any production facility.}

	abstract		= {Scope of the paper is to present a portfolio of promising design solutions currently available for the hydrogen value chain offshore and identify the most promising architectures for their deployment.  Hydrogen value chain is broken down by function and then by single process unit where applicable. Comparison of different design choices (i.  e centralised vs. decentralised) is provided based on the application of different Hydrogen production pathways and technologies and use of intermediate or final energy carrying methods (e.g. Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers, ammonia and ammonia carriers). A section is dedicated to pipeline transport offshore analyzing at high level the technology readiness also in terms of in-line subsea equipment. There are technologies or solutions at a lower readiness or in need of testing activity for confirming on a scientific basis the suitability for both Hydrogen and Offshore environment. The tests or initiatives required for gap areas are described.  In the analysis of the value chain, the ``direct offshore use'' for decarbonizing the shipping business is also analyzed considering the strong contribution of the sector in reaching the decarbonization target.  The analysis of the data collected through design cases application and market scouting offers a valid compass in the selection of the most suitable solution, even though, momentarily, some scenarios seem to be far from being achieved in the short term.  The paper gives a picture of how the energy transition focused on Hydrogen technologies and applied offshore is taking shape through a critical review of the data, the initiatives, the claims available along the supply chain from energy production to energy storage, transport and use. The overall conclusion is that the hydrogen value chain offshore is not only applicable but when based on lean, simple solutions, it promises to be very effective to concur to the net zero objective.}

	abstract		= {Carbon capture and storage is among a few technologies with the potential to enable significant CO2 emission reductions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as offshore production facilities. Within this context, many offshore operators are evaluating measures to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from their operations including those in Deepwater, and Energy contractors are re-shaping their technological expertise and potential solutions for meeting such challenging and increasing demand for lowering operations emissions.  The present paper will focus on a specific potential application, related to the offshore pipeline CO2 transportation from an offshore capture facility (deepwater or shallow water), to a permanent subsea storage location.  The work presented is the outcome of a joint effort by Exxon Mobil and Saipem articulated through phases:A framing exercise to shape different scenarios to be analyzed.  Engineering execution feasibility screening to characterize the above-mentioned scenarios, and to determine: What are the hurdles for deepwater CO2 capture, transportation via offshore pipeline and its sequestration?The challenges associated with CO2 transportation via an offshore pipeline, are spread among all the areas characterizing the system, e.g.:Flow Assurance: the flowing conditions of CO2 are strongly affected by the impurities content, and the bathymetry which the pipeline path traverses.  Material Selection: potential corrosion damage mechanisms must be carefully addressed vs. operating and transient flowing conditions.  Structural Integrity: the risk of failure associated with potential Running Ductile Fracture (RDF) must be considered and managed since early design phases.  Subsea Equipment: the equipment, not limited to the pipeline and riser, shall be assessed in terms of readiness and technological gaps, if any.  Safety: the potential risk of subsea CO2 dispersion shall be carefully evaluated.  Economics and Supportive Government Policy: Costs are generally key challenges associated with these potential emissions-reduction initiatives.  The study performed covered all the above areas through the involvement of Companies Engineering Departments, SME and Developers. All main building blocks of an offshore CO2 transport system have been analyzed during a high-level conceptual design activity to explore any potential criticality vs. their deployment in the specific application.  Location/asset-specific factors, supportive government policy, and continued technological advancements can be expected to remain important elements in operator analyses of the commercial viability of potential emissions reduction initiatives.  The findings from the presented activity provide offshore Operators considerations for the possibility of transporting CO2 between offshore CO2 capture location to sequestration reservoirs for permanent storage and provide the offshore industry with useful points of reflection.}

	abstract		= {As the global energy community moves towards the adoption of hydrogen and Natural Gas blends as a potential alternative to existing carbon-rich fuel, it is vital to develop the necessary infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen as a fuel and energy carrier of the future. Newer infrastructure is extremely cost-prohibitive and will significantly delay global decarbonization efforts. Transformation of existing infrastructure in handling hydrogen-based gas blends is the first step in achieving the targeted decarbonization goals.  Although existing natural gas pipelines may be suited for transporting hydrogen-natural gas blends, they are also vulnerable to leaks, embrittlement, and hydrogen-induced cracking, especially on newer high-strength steel (X70 or higher). This paper presents a new approach to preparing existing natural gas infrastructure for potential hydrogen-natural gas blends by protecting vulnerable steel surfaces with an advanced nanocomposite surface treatment. It remains, however, that understanding the impact of cyclic stress, fatigue, and the effect of hydrogen concentration on steel and surface-treated steel is vital to refining and advancing surface protection approaches.  To evaluate field operation conditions, a new experimental facility was set up, capable of conducting high pressure (up to 4000 psi) and high temperature (up to 572\textdegree{}F) testing following ASTM G142. High-pressure testing at 2000 psi in hydrogen blends indicates that the surface treatment has a strong barrier effect and demonstrated a reduction in the susceptibility to embrittlement under hydrogen. In addition, surface-treated coupons were installed in a commercial natural gas transmission pipeline that transports hydrogen (up to 15\%)-natural gas blends.  Decarbonization requires newer technologies that are designed to transform the current state-of-the-art energy infrastructure with minimal impact and at a rapid scale. The nanocomposite surface treatment presented here offers a highly scalable solution of in-place treatment of existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure to accelerate hydrogen-natural gas transportation and promote the use of low-carbon energy carriers for the energy industry and its end customers.}

	abstract		= {Planning is essential to navigate the challenges and uncertainties posed by climate change as offshore marine energy development proceeds over the coming decades. This paper introduces the prototype version of the Canadian Coastal Zone Information System (CCZIS), a pioneering initiative developed jointly by ASL Environmental Sciences Inc. and Trailmark Systems Inc. through the Innovative Solutions Canada Challenge administered by Public Services and Procurement Canada (ISC, 2020). The core functionality of CCZIS lies in its ability to provide spatial-statistical representations of key metocean parameters such as water levels, waves, sea ice conditions, vertical allowances, and marine winds. One of CCZIS's ground-breaking features is its integration of regional model-based projections derived from coupled atmosphere-ocean models such as The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). CMIP5 is a collaborative international effort that involves a collection of climate models used to simulate and project the Earth's climate system (Taylor et al., 2012; IPCC, 2013). CMIP5 was coordinated by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and facilitated the comparison of climate models from different global institutions. It served as a framework for assessing the performance of these models, advancing our understanding of climate processes, and providing projections for future climate conditions. CMIP5 models simulate a range of climate variables, including temperature, precipitation, sea ice extent, and atmospheric circulation. These simulations help scientists and policymakers explore potential future climate scenarios under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.  CMIP-5 model realizations for different relative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP) contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, providing valuable data and insights that inform climate research, impact assessments, and policy decisions. Spanning a variety of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, from the conservative RCP 2.0 to the more extreme RCP 8.5, these projections enable users to toggle between different climate change scenarios with the number representing the increase in net surface radiative forcing. This functionality allows for comparative analysis against metocean design criteria used in past projects against different potential future climate change scenarios, thereby allowing for the assessment of expected metocean extremes under each RCP scenario. A variety of other data sources were reviewed such as the Canadian Extreme Water Level Adaptation Tool (CAN-EWLAT) (Greenan, 2022), MSC-50 (Swail et. al., 2007), etc., and are described further in the analysis section.  CCZIS displays three-dimensional bathymetric and infrastructure data together, through the combination of several data sources: high-resolution Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) Non-Navigational (NONNA) bathymetry (CHS, 2023) dredging survey data, seabed properties (borehole data), and its support for the geo-referenced three-dimensional display of present and future coastal and offshore infrastructure. In addition, CCZIS has a built-in user input-driven computational tool for computing nearshore waves, for large marine wind events, at any selected location. The integration of hydrographic data, seabed properties, and existing infrastructure with hindcast and future-looking metocean conditions offers a unified data fusion platform to ensure resilient engineering of offshore marine energy installations, including wind farms, energy platforms, transmission infrastructure, as well as ports and small craft harbors where support vessel operations will be based.}

	abstract		= {Optimized moorings are essential to floating wind feasibility. The identification of key factors for the choice of mooring connection method is vital for the successful installation of a commercial scale floating offshore wind farm.  Commercial scale floating wind farms will require quick connection with minimization of costs, risk, safety hazards and operational time offshore. Furthermore, any delays in the installation of floaters can cause a bottleneck in the industrialized production line as wet storage in the ports are finite. These challenges make choosing the right technology early in the development and planning stages crucial. If the wrong strategy is chosen, offshore installation can become the most expensive part of the project.  A simple disconnection method must also be available for the future should there be a need to tow the floating offshore wind platform with turbine back to port for major maintenance.  Presenting a case study from a successful mooring hook up and tensioning operation for a recent Floating Production Unit (FPU), we evaluate an optimized strategy for the installation of a typical wind farm. The case study demonstrates quick connection and re-tensioning capabilities. Additionally, the ability to quickly disconnect for towing back to shore is evaluated.  Methods to reduce vessel spread requirements, increase weather windows and de-risk offshore operations are demonstrated.  Key factors are identified to assist in early-stage decision making which affect aspects of the floater design and installation strategies.  Increasing weather windows for mooring installation is critical to operational success. When projects reach storm safe condition expeditiously, costs and risk associated with anchor handlers, tugs, crew, and equipment are minimized. The metocean conditions in many floating wind farm locations pose challenges in the form of wave height and current. The industry must improve operational limitations for these conditions.  Choosing a method that reduces time offshore for anchor handling vessels with high day rates reduces project cost and increases schedule flexibility. The hook up and tensioning methodology selected have a direct effect on vessel spread required, project risk, and cost to support mooring operations. For example, if a mooring strategy can allow the use of smaller, potentially more available lower cost vessels for hook up and tensioning, the larger Anchor Handling Vessels needed to handle large chain can be reserved for pre-laying the mooring lines only and not needed for hook up and tensioning. This aspect of planning is discussed later in this paper.  The addition of unnecessary ``person-hours exposed to risk'' or the damage/loss of a floater due to poor mooring strategy cannot be accepted. The costs and delay impact project viability. Additionally, the potential reputational damage to the entire industry adds immeasurable risk to the success of both commercial scale floating wind farms and global emissions reduction targets.  When a poor mooring strategy causes undue delays, requires expensive ships, or creates unnecessary risk, the cost of individual mooring components becomes insignificant. Considering the hook up and tensioning method holistically and logistically significantly reduces human and project risk.}

Due to the lack of available literature, standard practices or industry guidelines on this topic, the authors performed in-house research on the subject. This paper deals with full scale testing performed to investigate the load-penetration behavior of armor rock. Tests comprised penetration of a steel pile section of a monopile into armor rock of two different gradings, placed on a sand bed in a 20 ft container. A DEM model with an equivalent setup was built and calibrated against the experimental test results and subsequently used to model a full size monopile case. Insight into the variability of penetration resistance was acquired by conducting multiple tests during the experimental and numerical modelling phases. Next to estimating self-weight penetration, knowing the penetration resistance over depth relation for a given scour protection layer provides an understanding of the penetration behavior of the pile at the transition zone between scour protection and seabed (i.e. potential for punch-through) and answers the question about necessity to use a piling hammer to penetrate the scour protection.}

	abstract		= {DNV and 38 project partners have been working together in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to identify, understand and tackle the challenges involved in taking the step from bottom-fixed to floating substations. A floating substation will be critical for many projects, to bring clean energy from floating offshore wind farms to the market and consumers. A floating substation is also a meeting point between different disciplines and stakeholders. The JIP involves a broad selection of the value chain representing this meeting point. The group includes both HV component and dynamic cable vendors, engineering companies, designers and yards and not the least companies that will operate and own; Developers and Transmission System Operators.  The objectives of the Floating Substations Joint Industry Project are to: (i) Identify technology gaps and the development and qualification efforts required close these gaps (ii) Identify gaps in standards and (iii) Establish joint understanding and alignment of best industry practice and technical requirements for design, construction, and operation of offshore floating substations. To meet these objectives, the project has defined a design basis, performed gap analyses, technology assessments and failure mode analyses for the key parts of floating substations. Both HVAC and HVDC systems have been addressed. Floater motion analyses and dynamic cable feasibility analyses have been performed and compared for suitability for carrying the HV equipment. Key questions to be answered include (i) what is the right safety level for design of a substation (or: what failure probability per year is acceptable) (ii) what are the motion characteristics of a substation and how does this compare to what the topside HV equipment can tolerate (iii) how can we qualify feasible export system designs. The project has undertaken defined activities to find answers to these questions.  The ultimate goal of the project has been to develop sufficient knowledge and cross-industry understanding to make floating substations a reality with an acceptable level of commercial, technical and HSE risk. The knowledge developed through the JIP will form basis for design standards for floating substations and dynamic cables. In this presentation, DNV will give an overview of the project results, the plans ahead for standard integration and required next steps.}

	abstract		= {The use of distributed buoyancy modules as a lateral buckle mitigation device in High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) flowlines requires consideration of a range of parameters to ensure a successful solution. An investigation into several of these parameters and their impacts on lateral buckling behavior is explored.  Buoyancy module spacing, the submerged weight in buoyancy sections, the buoyancy section configuration and length, and soil-pipe interactions at end modules are explored via the finite-element method. Sensitivities on these parameters for a single pipe diameter are explored as they relate to the lateral buckling behavior and associated industry-imposed limit states.  A rigid 8-inch HPHT production flowline is investigated for each of the parameters described. Finite-element models are used to investigate the lateral buckling behavior in virtual-anchor-spacing (VAS) models.  The VAS modeling of various distributed-buoyancy system parameters provides results that confirm the importance of adequately assessing these parameters in the design process.  VAS modeling demonstrates that buoyancy-module spacing, and buoyancy-section submerged weight, configuration, and length can all materially impact lateral buckling behavior and flowline integrity. It is found that each of these parameters needs to stay within a certain range for satisfactory performance, based on industry guideline VAS acceptance criteria and model stability, and going outside that range can yield unreliable and potentially risky lateral buckling behavior.  Ranges for the various parameters used in the design of distributed buoyancy sections are offered that will help ensure a robust and reliable distributed buoyancy solution.}

	abstract		= {In furtherance of advancing a tidal energy initiative, Littoral Power Systems, Inc. (LPS) endeavors to conceive, construct, and assess a comprehensive marine and riverine hydrokinetic current energy conversion apparatus within the Kootznahoo Inlet (Angoon, Alask a) under the aegis of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) \textendash{} Submarine Hydrokinetic and Riverine Kilo-megawatt Systems (SHARKS) project. Systematic surveys of tidal flow velocities, bathymetry, and water levels within the inlet were conducted to discern spatial and temporal flow variations, pinpointing the optimal deployment location for the device. Quasi-synoptic measurements of current speed and direction were captured along cross-inlet transects at the projected location of maximum flow velocity employing an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADCP). In tandem with these measurements, sophisticated one-dimensional (1D) DYNLET and Delft{3D} hydrodynamic circulation models were developed for the inlet. The numerical models were pivotal in extrapolating from flow measurements, thereby providing a thorough characterization and validation of spatial and temporal variations. Calibration and validation of the models were achieved using measured transect velocity data, subsequently employed to predict velocity estimates across the inlet throughout the tidal cycle. Comparative analyses revealed the consistent identification of the most robust flows during peak flood and ebb tide, proximate to the southeast side of the inlet (adjacent to the Village Rock) in relatively shallow water depths. The determination of tidal energy resources often entails a time-intensive and costly endeavor. Conventionally, two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional ({3D}) circulation models are developed to furnish time series velocity data, facilitating an assessment of the tidal energy resource at a given site. This paper presents a case study of tidal energy resource assessment and development at Kootznahoo Inlet, incorporating an economical 1D circulation model (DYNLET) in conjunction with a 2D version (Delft{3D}). The paper delineates the advantages and limitations of the 1D model, juxtaposed with the benefits and limitations inherent in the 2D approach.}

The vessel used for this project was R/V Seward Johnson, a Research/Survey vessel. The Piston Corer used for the survey, to work in depths above 3000 meters, was configured with a core head weighing 1,500 kg, with a maximum length of the sampling tube of 12 m and a 3.5 meters free fall. The samples were recovered in a 102 mm inner diameter plastic PVC (liner) coating within the 112 mm outer diameter steel tube. In addition to being stationary, the Piston Corer have a piston immobilizer, that protects the sample from disruptive forces during pull-out. The gravity CPT that was used in this campaign was coupled on Piston Corer structure, to function in the pressure of deep water. For this Project, gCPT tests was conducted to verify the soil resistance and Piston Corer samples collected, to analyze tactile-visual Classification, determination of moisture content, determination of apparent specific weight, evaluation of the content of Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and determination of Undrained Shear Strength (Su) by pocket penetometer test, torvane test and laboratory mini vane test. Through the piston core sampling and tactile visual classification, it was possible to define the soil content in the area, consisted of normally consolidated clays. This geotechnical survey has few locations to make a more accurate assessment of what may have occurred geologically in this area. Despite few evidence, analyzing the Piston Core samples onshore, along with gCPT results, the layers of deposition of the sediment were identified, with the general soil composition of the area being described as light brown clayed SILT with fine sand and shell fragments in the superficial sediments and dark gray silty CLAY with fine sand in the deeper sediments. The data produced from this campaign shows the possibility of geotechnical studies in areas of deep water, over 3500 meters depth, with reliable results. In order to work in a deep area, there were some alterations needed in the equipment, such as assembling the CPT in Piston Corer structure, and using a Piston immobilizer on the piston corer sampler. The improved equipment provided good quality data of the region.}

	abstract		= {Current measurements from a subsurface mooring offshore Guyana have been conducted by ExxonMobil in support for the oil and gas development in the area from March 2016 to March 2017. Understanding the current structure and inertial and sub-inertial period variations associated with the North Brazil Current (NBC) rings in the area are important to the development of the design and operational criteria off Guyana given the increase in activities by the oil and gas industry in the study region. The mooring was deployed near 57\textdegree{}W, 8\textdegree{}N in the water depth of 1678 m. Four NBC rings, which were measured during the one-year measurement campaign, can be categorized into three types based on their temporal and spatial (vertical) structures. The first two rings measured in the boreal spring of 2016 are shallow, fast-moving rings with the maximum penetration depth around 200m. The third ring is a slow-moving, deep feature with the penetration depth up to 1000 m. The fourth one is a fast-moving, deep ring with the penetration depth up to 800 m. A reversal current is observed flowing southwesterly along the coastline beneath all of the rings for the most part of the measurement period. Noteworthy inertial period variations are measured in the upper 200 m only with the arrival of the NBC rings and persistently in summer. Enhancement of the sub-inertial (5-10 days) variations is also detected in association with all four rings, suggesting that sub-inertial oscillations can be excited by the NBC rings.}

	abstract		= {This study explores the feasibility of CO2 transportation and injection for Korea's 1st large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in a depleted gas reservoir in the East Sea, South Korea. In this study, the necessity of heating CO2 at the offshore platform is examined. Operating envelope of the CO2 injector in light of near-wellbore Joule-Thompson (JT) cooling and hydrate formation is also investigated. The study informs the basis of facility design to attain the CO2 injection target.  Transient thermo-hydraulic simulations using OLGA were conducted to establish the safe operating envelope and optimal injection strategy. The study considered re-using the existing flowlines, offshore platforms, and wells. Two development strategies were considered, with or without heating CO2 at the offshore platform. Two reservoir pressures were considered: early life and late life. Hydrate formation risk in flowlines, well and near-wellbore areas were assessed.  This study assesses various methods to mitigate hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells within CCS projects. Each tested concept has distinct advantages and drawbacks, emphasizing the need for optimizing transport and injection systems to minimize energy consumption during steady injection.  The primary discovery indicates that implementing an early injection strategy is crucial for preventing hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells. The study reveals that heating CO2 during the initial injection phase proves ineffective in averting near-wellbore hydrate formation, mainly due to substantial heat dissipation in the subsea flowline. Furthermore, even with heating, fluid temperatures near the sandface drop below freezing, creating favorable conditions for hydrate formation. This approach enhances the economic viability of CCS projects by eliminating the need for costly mitigation methods, rendering them more financially appealing.  This study addresses CO2 injection challenges in highly depleted reservoirs for geologic sequestration. Our systematic approach optimizes transport and injection systems, thereby improving CCS project economics and making depleted fields more attractive for CO2 storage. Our results provide valuable insights into the feasibility of large-scale CCS in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, offering cost-effective hydrate mitigation methods, supporting viable CCS solutions, and contributing to global greenhouse gas reduction efforts.}

	abstract		= {This paper proposes an offshore Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) to interface with subsea oil and gas production systems and offshore renewable energy sources (like wind, floating solar, etc.). Such a HESS will provide a stable energy supply for an extended period, reducing the need for carbon-heavy backup systems such as diesel generators, thereby resulting in a much cleaner energy future. The proposed offshore architecture is modeled using a Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) along with offshore renewables (primarily wind energy), subsea loads (such as drives for pumps, compressors, etc.), and a medium voltage DC (MVDC) grid. Each unit of the HESS is constructed using an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen from electricity, a hydrogen tank to store the fuel, and a fuel cell to transform hydrogen back into electrical energy. Each unit has separate converters to step up/down the voltage. These units are further interconnected through a multi-level cascaded bridge architecture to achieve a 6 kV output. The multi-level cascaded bridge architecture ensures the reliable operation of the system by re-balancing the energy storage electrically between the cascaded mode and protecting the system from any misshape that happens in the system. Suppose a fault occurs in one of the fuel cell units. In that case, the cascaded bridge architecture disconnects that unit from the system. It compensates for that unit by recovering the difference voltage from the other units to maintain the 6 kV DC output voltage.}

The state-of-the-art ocean observing technologies provide near-real-time surface and subsurface co-located temperature, salinity and velocity observations and were assessed for improvements to the predictive capability of multiple federal and industry operational ocean circulation models. Six ocean buoyancy gliders were deployed in the western Yucatan Strait near Mahahual, M\'{e}xico - four of the gliders were deployed in January 2024, two gliders were deployed from July thru November 2023. The summer and fall 2023 glider data was assimilated into the NOAA RTOFS numerical model and significantly improved the model performance to accurately represent the vertical hydrographic structure of the inflowing water from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf of M\'{e}xico via the Yucatan Strait. The high-frequency radar system deployed near Cancun, M\'{e}xico was operational throughout the experiment. Radar observations of surface velocity during fall 2023 observed the passage of extreme weather events, including Hurricane Idalia (26 August \textendash{} 2 September). Additionally, the hi-frequency radar observed the spatial and temporal position of the Yucatan Current speed core as the Loop Current System in the Gulf of M\'{e}xico evolved from a retracted state to an extended state, to a detached state, with numerous reattachment sequences. The research underscores the complexity of the four-dimensional structure of the Loop Current system and the spatial and temporal evolution of the circulation in response to topographic, tidal, geostrophic, ageostrophic, and wind forcing. Additional observations from airborne and subsurface observational platforms reveal sub-mesoscale variability and the correlation between surface and subsurface current patterns.}

	abstract		= {Today’s society continues to be heavily dependent on hydrocarbons for its energy needs. At the same time, we are seeing high sensitivity in the oil prices due to global events like COVID pandemic or changing geopolitical landscapes. To manage these fluctuations E\&P companies are trying to become more efficient in the way they run their operations. This has challenged service companies to come with innovative solutions to help operators increase their hydrocarbon production with existing resources. This paper describes one such solution.  With decades of remote operations experience we now have an Integrated Operations execution model where advanced remote operations combined with latest technologies in digitization and automation can provide integrated solutions more safely, efficiently and sustainably. This model has 3 major components: Multi-skilled Field Professionals (FPRO) at rig site.  Remote Professionals at Integrated remote operations center.  Digital Technology enablers - Automation software, Rig communication technology, remote access, and visualization tools.  FPRO are multiskilled personnel performing surface equipment handling and physical tasks on the rigsite. The number of multiskilled personnel can vary between three for offshore and two for land operations. Further optimization is achieved by having FPRO floating between rigs wherever possible. The multiskilling framework is embedded in training and competency structure where competencies are assigned, trained, and monitored to get them completed. Once complete they can perform different tasks at the rigsite. Roles and responsibilities of FPRO, Remote Professionals and other personal are clearly defined. FPRO are supported by Drilling contractor personal and remote professionals operating from remote center. Remote Professionals are highly trained and competent SME’s which are based in remote center and work along with rigsite FPRO to ensure flawless and consistent service delivery. The remote professionals are competent and qualified to deploy different tools and services. They are supported by technical support team based out of remote center. Successful transition of up to 50\% tasks from rig site to a remote operation center is possible. POB reduction up to 67\% was achieved in one case.  Technology enablers are key to achieve the perfect synchronization and efficiency between the FPRO and Remote Professionals. Statement of requirement (SOR) for connectivity and rig infrastructure for communication are defined. Automation software’s in Drilling Services, Automated Pressure Pumping unit and Automated Fluid Monitoring system act as enablers. Digital visualization tools and optimization software are further enablers. The Integrated Operations model as a service offering aims to drive standardization through alignment with customer requirements, HSE drivers, global operational procedures, competency development, Service delivery and financial KPIs. This is a steppingstone in the process to change the way operators and service companies operate at rigsite.}

The first part of the paper provides an overview of the Energy Trilemma (Sustainability, Security and Equity) followed by an introduction on the importance of data collection and analysis necessary to monitor energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions associated with offshore drilling rigs. It highlights the significant energy requirements for drilling and mobilization activities along with the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions contribute to climate change and environmental degradation, necessitating clear actions for reducing carbon footprints.  The paper highlights the economic and environmental benefits associated with energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the potential cost savings resulting from reduced energy consumption and the avoidance of carbon-related taxes or penalties. Furthermore, it reviews a 360-degree approach to Offshore Drilling Rig Decarbonization embedding it into operations, operator-contractor engagements, and technical advances. It also emphasizes the positive impact of such initiatives on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainability, and improving the industry's environmental stewardship.  Next, the paper discusses the potential strategies for enhancing energy efficiency on offshore drilling rigs. It examines advancements in optimized rig design, energy efficiency upgrades, energy storage systems and sustainable behavior enhancements. Additionally, it explores the adoption of low-carbon fuels and electrification of offshore rigs. The proven and expected benefits, challenges, and implementation considerations of these strategies are examined.  In conclusion, achieving energy efficiency and decarbonization on offshore drilling rigs is essential for addressing the Energy Trilemma while it is necessary that the drilling contractor and operator work closely together in operating the business in a way that meets economic, social, and environmental needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By embracing innovative technologies, optimizing operations, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, offshore drilling rigs can significantly reduce their carbon footprints while ensuring a sustainable and responsible future for the industry.}

	abstract		= {The casing system plays a crucial role in the integrity of oil and gas wells throughout their life cycle, providing tightness, stability, and support to external loads. This paper applies reliability-based models to the design of top-hole casing sections, taking into account uncertainties associated with soil behavior and casing tubulars manufacturing. Typical load scenarios are addressed to estimate the probability of occurrence of different soil-casing system failure modes.  Reliability-based techniques stand out as powerful solutions for structural analysis and design. This work assesses soil characterization data from piezocone tests (CPTu) to statistically describe some mechanical parameters used for conductor and surface casing design. Random variables associated with the material and geometrical properties of tubulars are also considered, based on tubular manufacturing data presented in API/TR 5C3 (2018). The probabilistic models are developed by using the First Order Reliability Method (FORM), an expedited and accurate optimization-based procedure, and applied to various load scenarios to estimate failure probability in the context of top-hole casing design. Finite Element (FE) modeling is employed for the integrity analysis of the soil-casing system.  Analyses have been carried out considering the variability associated with undrained soil strength evaluated from CPTu data, as this soil strength is expected to be the most relevant random variable due to its spatial heterogeneity. Other random variables taken into account are the outer diameter and wall thickness of casing tubulars, resulting from the variability in manufacturing process. Results indicate the feasibility and relevance of the proposed FE-FORM analysis in estimating the probability of occurrence of relevant failure modes defined following the oil company’s internal regulations regarding conductor casing load capacity and surface casing triaxial stress in the non-cemented region. For the specific case studies presented, failure probabilities ranged from the order of magnitude of 10-9 to inadmissible values approaching 50\%. Concerning how random variables affect the probabilistic response, it is observed that the outer diameter is not significant due to its low dispersion.  The novelty consists of considering both in-situ soil information and casing manufacturing data in a reliability-based framework that enables a more robust structural integrity analysis, supporting the decision-making process in top-hole design. This solution was implemented in the operator’s internal software and uses real data. Quantifying the soil-and-casing uncertainties by using a robust statistical-based methodology brings new information, enhancing knowledge about the variability of design parameters and its influence on the structural response.}

	abstract		= {The world's demand for metal is rising and new solutions must be explored to meet the needs associated with population growth, urbanization, decarbonized energy systems and circular economy goals. There is increasing recognition that seafloor minerals could help diversify the world's supply of responsibly sourced minerals and metals. As an example, polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean contain substantial quantities of nickel, cobalt, manganese and copper \textendash{} all are minerals that have been highlighted as being important for the energy transition. A number of entities are undertaking mineral exploration in the CCZ, and some are developing technology for the collection of nodules on a commercial scale. One of the key components is a lift system to bring the nodules from the seafloor to a surface support vessel/platform. This study examines the feasibility of using a modified marine drilling riser for a Vertical Transport System (VTS) for deep-sea mining operations. In particular, it examines whether it would be feasible to use such a configuration during a System Integration Test (SIT), a full-scale mining trial which could be executed ahead of commercial mining operations. This paper examines several topics including: Rated capacity of existing marine drilling riser joints and handling equipment.  Drill ship and drilling riser joint modifications.  The arrangement of riser joints and pump modules, including the influence on riser dynamics.  Effects of internal fluids on riser dynamics.  Operability of the riser within the CCZ metocean environmentModified riser fatigue analysis.  Initially a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters have the most effect on the dynamic behavior of the riser. Afterwards, many iterations were simulated with different variables tested such as pump locations, riser joint types, buoyancy distributions, etc., in order to optimize the design of the riser. After validation of the in-house simulations, the second phase of the study analyzed the riser dynamics including the effects of internal fluids while the riser is pumping slurry. The operability and fatigue analysis were conducted using a 35-year hind-cast metocean data set, based on wave buoys, satellites and models.  The study resulted in a riser configuration that provided high operability (\textasciitilde{}99.9\%) and sufficient fatigue life to conduct a test mining campaign in the Clarion Clipperton Zone. The proposed mining riser consists of existing riser joints and new-build joints hung-off on the spider-gimbal of the drill ship during operations (Hard hang-off). The existing riser joints need to undergo minor modifications to be able to reuse them for the mining riser. The riser modifications work with the vessel's existing handling equipment to deploy and retrieve the mining riser with minor changes.  The study concludes that a modified marine drilling riser offers an economical, technically and environmentally suitable solution for a deep-sea mining vertical transport system used during the SIT.}

	abstract		= {The North Brazil Current Rings (NBCRs) are a dominant phenomenon in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Guyana, which introduces substantial challenges and risks to offshore activities. Gaining a comprehensive grasp of the vertical current structure and variations linked to NBCRs is important for design and safe operations in the region. This study addresses the intricate attributes of NBCRs, utilizing data acquired from two deepwater moorings offshore Guyana. These moorings, equipped with current measuring instruments, were stationed along the pathway of NBCRs with the goal to capture their dynamic behavior and inherent variability.  One mooring was deployed in the water depth of about 1600 meters for 18 months. During this time, a total of seven NBCRs were observed, which were sorted into distinct categories based on their temporal and vertical characteristics. Four of these rings displayed surface current intensification, with peak near surface currents reaching 1.62 m/s. These rings were confined to the uppermost 200 meters of the water column. Diverging from this pattern, two rings exhibited a distinctive attribute\textemdash{}both surface and subsurface intensifications\textemdash{}with peak subsurface currents reaching \textasciitilde{}1 m/s at a depth between 200 and 300 meters. Finally, one ring lacked the typical surface intensification and only exhibited subsurface intensification (currents reaching \textasciitilde{} 1 m/s at 300m below the surface). Throughout the measurement period, a prevailing southwesterly-directed reversal current persisted within the lower part of the water column.  The second mooring was positioned in the water depth of around 1850 meters. Its 12-month deployment period overlapped with the final year of the first mooring’s deployment, therefore this secondary mooring witnessed the occurrence of four rings observed by the other mooring. The observations confirmed the occurrence of the distinctive current profiles: two rings with surface plus subsurface intensification and one ring with subsurface intensification only. The second mooring also demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of those rings.  This study’s significance extends beyond mere rings’ identification and description, unveiling the presence of novel current profiles with simultaneous near-surface and subsurface intensifications of comparable magnitudes. Additionally, it brought to light increased subsurface current speeds and distinct temporal behavior of these currents. These findings demonstrate the need for continuing measurements and modeling of circulation in the area to better understand and predict the events.}

ExxonMobil, Chevron, Talos, Denbury, Occidental, Repsol and many other companies are forming partnerships to take advantage of evolving business opportunities or government co-funding of CarbonSAFE projects.  The Gulf Coast corridor, onshore and offshore, from Corpus Christ to the Mississippi River presents a high concentration of CO2 from industrial sources and excellent storage reservoirs in the underlying Cretaceous and Tertiary sands. Analysis of the technical, geologic, economic and social aspects of this CCS opportunity is necessary for successful deployment of CCS technology and eventual attainment of NetZero goals.  To provide analysis of the CCS opportunity along the Gulf Coast Corridor, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has developed a CO2 Transport Cost Model and an Onshore CO2 Storage Cost Model. Nearing completion is the Offshore CO2 Saline Storage Cost Model. These models can provide comparative analysis of storage and transport opportunities for multiple CO2 sources to storage locations onshore, offshore or between either.  The Onshore CO2 Storage Cost Model is aligned with EPA’s Class VI regulations which are also applicable in offshore State waters. Carbon dioxide storage regulations for offshore operations in Federal waters are being developed, built upon existing offshore oil \& gas operations but are expected to dovetail with onshore Class VI regulations to minimize any conflicting requirements.  Financing CCS project development and operations is a primary challenge that is evolving towards a solution. A key component here is the 45Q credit, which in turn will support offtake agreements between a source and storage operations.  Initial industry interest in the Gulf Coast region presents an opportunity to examine business opportunities for deployment of CCS technology in this area, either onshore, offshore of both.}

	abstract		= {Offshore floating wind turbines experience greater pitch and heave motions than their fixed counterparts, resulting in component fatigue that reduces the longevity of the turbine structure. While various vibration control systems have been proposed to reduce vibrations, this paper proposes a novel non-linear tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI) system within the columns of the semi-submersible platform that is able to simultaneously dampen vibrations and harvest power from the vibrations. As such, the design essentially incorporates three wave-energy converter power take-off systems within the floating platform structure. Modeling of three non-linear TMDIs within the system was completed using a Euler-Lagrangian approach and optimization was completed using pattern search in MATLAB. The nonlinear TMDIs performed better than the linear TMDIs and tuned mass-dampers (TMDs) over the broader frequency range but underperformed the linear TMDIs and TMDs at peak loading. This indicates promise for regions with highly variable wave conditions; however, the TMDs and linear TMDIs may still perform better on semi-submersible platforms in some offshore locations. For identical vibrational performance, the linear and non-linear TMDIs required lighter secondary masses than TMDs. Additionally, theoretical power potential from the TMDI generator increased with the introduction of nonlinearity for most design cases.}

	abstract		= {Traditionally, verification of equipment and systems has been carried out by deploying surveyors to perform physical verifications. Today, the development of digital twins, representing physical assets, provides the possibility to leverage data to enhance and replace the conventional verification and validation efforts undertaken by industry stakeholders. Digitalization, new technologies, algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI), incorporated in digital twins, can be used to execute effective verifications. When such digital twins have proven to provide genuine and trustworthy evidence, the evidence can be used in assessments towards specified acceptance criteria, and issue, maintain, and renew certificates. Some parts of the assessment itself may even become automated through the use of algorithms and AI solutions, further increasing the importance of the rigor and intensity with which these digital twins must be qualified and assured. This paper is developed in order to support the development of trustworthy digital twins for data-driven-verification (DDV) systems and methods. Use of digital twins should be acceptable as long as they provide the same, or higher, level of assurance as the traditional methods. DDV also aims at reducing non-productive time, costs associated with surveyors attending the physical asset, redundant verification activities, and the knowledge sharing, and transfer burden imposed upon the asset organization.}

	abstract		= {Lost Circulation is a well-documented drilling industry issue stemming back to when oil wells were first drilled, and today lost circulation still represents a significant challenge when drilling a well bore. Drilling a well bore using standard drilling practice uses a drilling fluid to act as a primary safety barrier, a drill bit cooling medium and a method to transport drilling cuttings from the well bore. The drilling fluid is continually circulated during drilling operation: down the drill pipe, back to surface up the annulus created between the drill pipe and well bore, drillings cuttings are then removed from the drilling fluid, and the drilling fluid then pumped back down the drill pipe. Lost circulation is where the drilling fluid pumped down the drill string no longer arrives back at surface but leaks into the formation through which the well bore is being drilled. Lost Circulation events can represent well control issues, significant drilling fluid costs, lost time in controlling and/or remedial curing operations. These issues are documented to add millions to the cost of drilling operations annually.  Lost Circulation is described using several categories that relate to the rate of the loss and mechanism of the loss event, these categorized descriptions are then used to catalogue and describe the types of solutions available to cure the lost circulation.  Lost Circulation severity is categorized by the volume of drilling fluid that is lost or not returned to surface. The widely accepted categories used are ‘Seepage’, ‘Partial’, ‘Severe’ and ‘Total’ Losses. Each of the four categories are defined with a fluid loss flow rate, some generally accepted definition rates are shown in Table 1 (Drilling Specialties Company, 2014).}

Firstly, well slot expansion technology of old offshore platform including hanging well slots inside and outside the offshore platform considering structure strength of old platform. Secondly, sidetracking new wells from old wells with low production is proposed to develop remaining oil near the old platform and sidetracking point is optimized towards deep to reduce footage. Thirdly, combined with reservoir, multilateral branch wells are drilled to improve oil drainage area and enhance oil recovery, moreover, branch bore open hole anchor and external packer are developed to hang sand control screen pipe and maintain wellbore stability instead of leaving branch hole without any sand control methods.  Well slot expansion technology has been used in old platforms, and 35\% wells slots have been added to drill new wells to develop remaining oil around old platform. In old well sidetracking, advanced sidetracking tool with high build up rate reaching 120 deg/100 ft is developed and applied in many wells including T shaped well, the sidetracking points have been moved down and the overall footage have been reduced compared with conventional build up tools, and single well construction period have been reduced by 2 days. Multilateral branch wells with 1268 meters long main bore and 2 branch bores have been successfully completed with open hole anchor and external packer to hanger sand control screen pipe, and the production rate is twice as that of the original branch bore without any sand control method.  This technology has been applied in Bohai Oilfield and new platforms have been saved every year as re-utilization of well slots, which can also provide reference for other offshore oil fields.}

	abstract		= {Bohai Oilfield is rich in unconventional heavy oil reserves where the viscosity of formation crude oil is more than 50000 cP and mobility are poor. To produce heavy oil from formation to the surface and transport it to processing terminal is recognized as a worldwide challenge, especially for offshore oilfield for development cost.  Taking the development idea of ``Overall deployment, Step-by-step implementation, and Test first'' for technical research, the pilot test of thermal recovery was successfully carried out in Bohai Oil fields for the first time. Facing well head elevation and annulus pressure build up problems caused by high injection temperature (350\textdegree{}C), the low-density cementing slurry system is developed to ensure the cementing quality; Casing material and sand control method are optimized and selected to ensure wellbore integrity and sand control effectiveness, and other down hole safety control tools have also been optimized for high pressure and temperature.  The results show that after 28 days of bath at 350\textdegree{}C, the uni-axial compressive strength of the newly developed cement stone can basically be stabilized, which indicates that the cement stone has good high-temperature stability and well head evaluation problems have been mitigated. The proposed injection-production jet pump integration process is that the heat injection process and the production process use one set of production strings to realize the efficient connection between heat injection and production, and the operating cost is reduced. The long-term sand control technology for thermal recovery wells has been proposed, and 8 rounds of field tests have been completed with the sand content of the produced fluid is less than 0.3\textperthousand{}; The high-temperature down hole safety control system including high-temperature down hole safety valve, high-temperature thermal production packer and other key tools have been developed to build a safety barrier.  These technologies have been successfully applied in Bohai Oilfield, helping Bohai Oilfield achieve a breakthrough in the large-scale and economic development of ultra-heavy oil.}

The present numerical wave basin tool is called Wind Turbine Numerical Wave Basin (WTNWB) and is capable of providing wind-turbine performances and tower structural responses as well as 6-DOF platform motions and mooring tensions in high-fidelity. The coupled analysis demonstrates excellent agreement with the model test in the prediction of platform motions and mooring line tensions. WTNWB can overcome known drawbacks of two types of physical model testing methods: full physical model testing and real-time hybrid model testing. WTNWB is now ready to be used in FOWT projects for global performance analysis and is capable of more complicated test cases to consider blade elasticity, pitch control, and other possible sensitivity tests available in OpenFAST.}

	abstract		= {Deep transient pressure testing, using a state-of-the-art formation testing platform, allows deeper investigation into a subsurface formation compared to previous wireline-conveyed testing techniques. Given the associated interaction of the pressure with more varied geological features, numerical reservoir models and simulations are generally required to capture the reservoir or formation heterogeneity that may be encountered during a test. However, the long computation time of such numerical simulation poses challenges for some critical interpretation tasks, such as model inversion.  We propose a novel method for the parameter estimation in geologically complex reservoirs by conducting Bayesian inversion with surrogate models. To account for the geology complexity, we utilize surrogate models constructed through the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method, to substitute for the numerical simulators. It allows simulating the pressure response in a timely manner while at the same time providing global sensitivity analysis for each uncertain parameter in the model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is then employed with the surrogate models for conducting the Bayesian inversion with pressure transient measurements.  We analyze the properties of PCE surrogate models and demonstrate that, for typical pressure transient interpretation tasks, sufficiently accurate surrogates can be constructed from an ensemble of 200 to 500 numerical model evaluations. These evaluations are performed concurrently in a cloud-based environment thus reducing the time-cost for surrogate model training to less than an hour. We then perform the Bayesian inversion on the pressure measurements and effectively characterize the model parameters with their associated uncertainties via the posterior distributions. The problem of MCMC inversion is solved in a few minutes using the surrogate models.  Through our studies, we demonstrate that the adoption of surrogate models considerably reduces the computation time required, allowing the Bayesian inversion to be completed within minutes, which was unachievable with the numerical simulators. Furthermore, this new method offers accurate parameter estimations and provides posterior distributions of uncertain parameters, as well as unveiling correlations among the parameters for the interpretation of measurement. These capabilities were lacking in the current inversion process utilizing numerical simulators. Finally, the new method lends itself well to workflow automation for history matching, thus reducing the workload on petrotechnical experts and addressing today's imperatives of faster and more cost-efficient field development.}

	abstract		= {Offshore locations present significant potential for geologic carbon storage (GCS). Key differences and benefits over onshore GCS include locations distal from population centers and abundant, high-quality reservoirs. Yet, offshore GCS projects also face major logistical challenges, such as metocean conditions and more costly operations. Co-saline storage is a proposed concept to defray costs and risks to candidate offshore GCS operations, while leveraging advanced U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), peer-reviewed models to support and expedite implementation.  Assessing for co-saline storage potential involves applying custom GCS risk and resource models to identify and quantify opportunities for safe carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into saline reservoirs while concurrently producing from nearby petroleum reservoirs. Co-saline storage allows for reuse of existing infrastructure, data, and project knowledge associated with hydrocarbon production.  Offshore GCS efforts to date have focused on either enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or dedicated saline storage. This paper shows how the use of artificial intelligence-informed models, optimized for offshore GCS and infrastructure risk evaluation, can identify co-saline storage prospects and offer economic and operational benefits for offshore GCS.  Over the last decade there have been advances in analytical capabilities that combine geo-data science, artificial intelligence, and domain science methods in multi-modeling approaches to improve evaluation and forecasting of risks and resource potential in offshore systems. These peer-reviewed technologies have been integrated into a workflow to assist with identification of locations with existing hydrocarbon production that are suitable candidates for co-saline storage. When used together with commercial data and tools, this geo-data science method can be used by industry and regulators to assess where and potentially how best to configure platforms, wells, and reservoirs to enable CO2 injection into stacked saline reservoirs while producing from existing hydrocarbon plays. This enables strategic reuse of existing infrastructure to defray costs and enable long-term CO2 storage in favorable offshore geologic settings. Ultimately, the co-saline storage approach provides users and stakeholders with data and science-based analyses to inform safe regulatory and operational decisions related to offshore GCS systems.  Decarbonization will require a range of approaches to meet domestic and international climate and operational goals. Existing projects and efforts have focused on single-approach efforts (e.g. EOR, pure saline-storage) to demonstrating the economic and operational viability of offshore GCS. This paper offers a strategic modeling approach for assessing co-saline storage potential (Figure 1). The approach incorporates existing offshore infrastructure and economic benefits from ongoing hydrocarbon production and plays to identify safe and viable GCS locations.

	abstract		= {The oilfield technology of casing drilling in the form of Riserless Casing Drilling is being adapted to provide a robust and cost-effective anchoring system for offshore wind turbine and other floating offshore structures. As the world transitions from the global dependence on hydrocarbons for energy to sustainable, renewable electrical generation, hundreds of offshore wind generation stations will need to be installed. The development of offshore floating electricity generation has been struggling with its economic feasibility. One of the key issues is that increasing costs, due to the water depth and adverse subsea soil conditions, has been challenging project economics. Floating wind generated electricity has a key role to play in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, to be competitive and for its market share to dramatically increase, floating wind electricity generation needs to reduce its development costs to levels at or below that of competing sources of electrical generation (NREL, 26 Feb 2020).  Anticipated cost reductions will come from many project elements including increased capacity wind turbines, reducing the number of turbines required per project. However, these larger turbines increase the anchoring and mooring system requirements increasing the project costs. The current anchoring systems of higher capacity, which include suction anchors, hydraulically installed pile anchors and drilled-grouted anchors, have limited anchoring capacities. Increased anchoring requirements for larger turbines would require more anchors. More anchoring and mooring systems increase cost and increases the environmental impact. In addition, the current anchoring systems are not suitable for many subsea soil conditions, particularly hard formations, nor can they be installed in inclement conditions placing additional constraints on floating wind generation.  Subsea Anchoring System can provide very high load (pullout) anchoring capacities, better suited for all soil conditions, and can be installed in far rougher sea conditions. One advantage is that fewer anchors would be required, compared to current anchoring systems, for the high anchoring capacity requirements of tension leg platforms (TLP). This anchoring technology is a pile or casing drilled in to predetermined depth using casing drilling technology. It is a one trip system of drilling the hole with the casing to then immediately cement upon reaching anchoring depth. This system provides anchoring capacities determined by the drilled depth, diameter of anchoring casing and competent casing-to-cement-to-formation contact to provide anchoring capacities far exceeding existing anchoring. This operation would be done with existing mobile oilfield drilling units. The installation costs are more costly than the current high capacity anchoring technologies however since less anchors as required per floating wind turbine than current practices, including safety factor redundancies, the total anchoring and mooring cost would be reduced.}

	abstract		= {Offshore wind power has become a priority in the United States because it has the potential to unlock substantial resources to deliver both economic and environmental benefits toward a net-zero emissions goal. Recent analysis suggests that up to 2,000 GW of offshore wind capacity will be needed by 2050 to keep global temperature increases below 1.5\textdegree{}C. At present, there is no offshore wind capacity in emerging markets other than China, and established energy markets like that of the United States have quite a way to go before offshore wind makes up a significant percentage of the energy mix. Changing the status quo is critical if the world is to meet ambitious targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and change needs to happen soon. ``The long development timescales for offshore wind mean that efforts need to start now to ensure delivery of new capacity''1 (World Bank \textendash{} Key Factors for Successful Development of Offshore Wind in Emerging Markets - 2021).  Creating a supply chain is a challenge, but it also is an opportunity because it presents the industry with a chance to take a holistic approach to building out capabilities from the ground up to deliver a healthy, diverse and sustainable supply chain that enables large-scale deployment and can support mass manufacturing and well-paying jobs for the years to come.  This paper analyzes multiple elements of the floating wind industry based on the experience of executing two operating floating wind projects and how this experience and these elements influence the formation of the supply chain system with special focus on the constraints and opportunities in developing a supply chain that is reliable and sustainable.  Focus areas include: Addressing uncertainty in the pipeline of projects by leveraging policy incentives and understanding the regulatory environment and its role in expediting offshore wind projectsAddressing constrained space challenges and construction processes and planning for serial productionCombining resources to update ports and shipyards that are not equipped to support floating offshore windIncentivizing young people to enter the offshore wind industry and training a specialized workforceEstablishing technology readiness and suitability for mass manufacturing and large-scale deploymentReducing risk by establishing clear deployment goalsSourcing raw materialsSourcing products that benefit local communities.

	abstract		= {The objective of this paper is to outline the conceptual process design for producing green hydrogen from electrolysis of water, using electricity generated from offshore wind farms. This study exemplifies the production of hydrogen based on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis installed on the dedicated hydrogen production hub. The envisioned ``hydrogen hub'' represents a comprehensive green hydrogen production system, relying on a presumed 200 MW power supply from an offshore substation within an 810 MW offshore wind farm. The entire system is placed on a dedicated offshore three-deck fixed platform, which is between the offshore wind farm substation and onshore facility. The desalinated seawater is supplied to the PEM electrolyzer for producing green hydrogen. Hydrogen will be processed, compressed, and stored onboard. A high-level economics of the process design of the hydrogen production system will be evaluated using the open-source software. The paper is based on publicly available information on an 810 MW offshore wind farm as an example of a field case study.  This study intends to demonstrate the conceptual process design for green hydrogen production powered by an offshore wind farm. The hydrogen production process is designed considering the availability of surplus power from one of the existing offshore wind farms. The economics of the process are evaluated and discussed. Our design analysis shows that the process of hydrogen production appears promising and can be applied to commercial scale offshore wind farms. The current cost estimate of producing green hydrogen from the offshore wind energy seems economically significant. However, the ongoing technological advances show that the costs of hydrogen producing equipment and power needed from the offshore wind farms may reduce significantly in near future. The conceptual process design and high-level economic analysis performed in this study is intended to be a small step in understanding the economics of green hydrogen production and advancing energy sustainability.  This paper introduces a process design technology and economic analysis for renewable hydrogen production, utilizing offshore wind energy as applied to a field case study. This contributes to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and achieve net zero emissions goals. Leveraging expertise in offshore/subsea engineering and petroleum engineering, this research advances the knowledge and skills required for renewable energy production, balancing supply and demand, and sustainability.}

This study aims to develop an advanced methodology that extends the application of Cone Penetration Testing (CPT), providing a more precise and detailed classification of subsurface soils in the locations without coring. Then, the methodology integrates advanced techniques to achieve precise geological characterization. It initiates with a dual-parameter clustering analysis, a process pivotal in uncovering nuanced geological insights. Submerged unit weight and undrained shear strength, recognized as primary indicators, are meticulously examined in the designated coring sites. The K-means algorithm, a unsupervised machine learning technique, is employed in this clustering analysis. It iteratively refines the classification by strategically grouping data points based on their proximity in the dual-parameter domain. Then, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture is designed to synthesize the outcomes of the clustering analysis with the extensive dataset obtained from Cone Penetration Testing (CPT). This network undergoes a training process using a combination of current program data and historical datasets from various regions.  This integrated approach capitalizes on the strengths of both Kmeans clustering and neural networks. While Kmeans excels in identifying patterns and grouping data points in a two-dimensional space, neural networks are adept at learning complex relationships within data. By combining these methodologies, the study achieves a synergistic effect, resulting in a highly accurate and detailed classification of subsea soils. Compared to conventional CPT classification methods, our approach demonstrates superior precision and granularity. By incorporating dual-parameter clustering and machine learning, the methodology refines geological classification and description, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the physical properties of subsea soils.}

	abstract		= {The buoyant tower, or BT, is a unique concept that stems from, and is a hybrid of, spar and compliant tower technologies. A BT is composed of one or a group of cylinders anchored to the seabed by a single suction caisson foundation (SCF). The BT rolls in a compliant manner while keeping the base from moving in any direction. The first application of BT is CX-15, a production platform in the Corvina Field offshore Peru. The 10-year-long operation since 2012 has provided a vast volume of data and experiences that support the IP-holder to re-visit this concept for extending the design to offshore wind, i.e., w.  BT.  This paper summarizes a recent experimental and numerical study on SCF, one of the key components of a BT or a w.  BT, subjected to cyclic loads. Unlike most of SCFs used for offshore O\&G industries, the SCF of a BT or a w.  BT needs to maintain adequate load-bearing capacities after enduring repeated rolling motions. The vertical loads come from the difference between the weight of the platform and the buoyancy, which varies with the draft changes due to waves and tides. The horizontal loads mainly come from cyclic wave loads on the hull. These conditions are seldom studied, and little is known about the bearing capacity of SCFs under such loading conditions. Also because of the unique configuration of the BT, there is no design guidance available in the existing standards that are fully applicable. The current study aims to understand the reduced vertical and horizontal load-bearing capacities of the BT's SCF after constant cyclic rolling as well as the failure mechanisms of the soil surrounding the SCF. The relevant working conditions were studied with 1:100 geotechnical centrifuge model tests. The bearing capacities of the SCF were carefully studied with a focus on reduction of the SCF's bearing capacity subjected to cyclic rolling of the BT. The test results were also used to calibrate a numerical analysis procedure that will be used for the design of SCF for w.  BT.}

Brazil, as a significant emitter, is actively pursuing CCUS projects and the state of Rio de Janeiro, with its high emissions of industrial activities, presents an opportunity for establishing a CCUS hub. The potential storage reservoir, S\~{a}o Tom\'{e} Deep Saline Formation, located in the Campos Basin, offers favorable characteristics for CO2 storage. This srtdy aims to estimate the CO2 storage capacity, perform uncertainty analysis, and comprehensive risk assessments for the Sao Tome reservoir. The methodology involves mapping potential storage reservoirs, {3D} geological modeling, and flow simulation to evaluate injectivity, storage potential, containment safety, and monitoring strategies. The results demonstrate a storage capacity of approximately 1 Gt of CO2, injectivity of 1.5 MMt C02/yr/well, and low leakage risk. However, further evaluation is required, including petrophysical characterization and geomechanical data. The proposal includes drilling a new well to acquire additional information and support more robust modeling. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would bring economic, social, and environmental benefits, attracting companies seeking environmentally friendly solutions and facilitating the development of the shallow-water industry. To achieve the Net Zero Scenario by 2050, CCUS plays a crucial role in emissions reduction, and the Sao Tome reservoir presents significant potential for CO2 storage. Continued evaluation and data acquisition are necessary to ensure the feasibility of large-scale CO2 injection projects. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would position the region as a center of environmental responsibility and attract investment and innovation in the energy sector.}

	abstract		= {The aging pipeline infrastructure in the United States raises concerns about potential greenhouse gas leaks, corrosion damage, and catastrophic failures. Many pipelines are 30 to 60 plus years in service with an average age of over 40 years. The three main causes of pipeline gas interruption are material or weld failure, corrosion, and excavation damage. As pipelines age, these risks increase. In addition, there is increased interest in repurposing the existing pipeline networks for hydrogen and hydrogen-methane blends. Refurbishment of existing pipelines to prevent corrosion damage, and subsequent gas leaks and preparation for hydrogen transport will significantly accelerate decarbonization efforts.  Traditional approaches to refurbishing existing pipelines utilize coatings such as fusion bond epoxy or polymer-based liner. These materials provide corrosion protection but are difficult to install on active natural gas networks without significant service interruption. Often sections of pipe need to be removed for offsite repair and refurbishment. In this paper, the authors present a novel smart liner technology that is designed for on-site installation in existing natural gas pipelines. The goal of the liner is to be installed without pipe removal, avoiding major interruptions to gas service.  This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the development of an advanced liner technology with thorough characterization of the various layers of material involved and the performance against corrosion and hydrogen. The liner material, with various topcoats for corrosion prevention, was evaluated using linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under a CO2-saturated 3.5wt\% NaCl solution. Corrosion studies demonstrated an advanced nanocomposite omniphobic surface treatment with a corrosion rate of 0.5x10-6mm/year at a thickness of \textasciitilde{}20$\mu$m. In addition, the omniphobic treated liner showed strong adhesion strength and resistance against folding/bending.  Refurbishment, repair, and transformation of natural gas pipeline networks require new technologies that enable modification with limited interruption to the gas transport at a fraction of the cost of new metal pipelines. The advanced composite liner technology presented here offers a unique solution aimed at overcoming existing installation challenges for corrosion prevention, H2 transport, and leak mitigation.}

	abstract		= {Soil behavior assessment is an essential part for the design of offshore wind farm foundations, especially for those situated nearshore with layered soil profiles. This paper presents the key results and study findings of an offshore geotechnical site investigation campaign conducted for a large wind farm development project along the US Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore New Jersey, specifically focusing on the cohesionless soils encountered at the study site. As indicated by Andersen, et al., (2023), the static, cyclic, and dynamic soil parameters for offshore wind turbine foundation design include static and cyclic shear strength, deformation parameters, initial shear modulus, Gmax, consolidation and deformation characteristics, effective stress (drained) strength parameters, and damping. In this paper, the conventional index and physical properties for the cohesionless soils are discussed together with the stress history (overconsolidation ratio, OCR), deformation (static secant modulus, E50), and permeability characteristics and dynamic initial shear modulus (Gmax)evaluated from the in situ cone penetration tests (CPTs) and onshore laboratory testing. The undrained and drained shear strength parameters (effective peak friction angles, residual friction angles, and dilation angles) and strength anisotropy from direct shear (DS), direct simple shear (DSS), and triaxial tests of the cohesionless soils are addressed.  Results of the soil/steel interface residual strength measured from a suite of ring shear tests on reconstituted cohesionless samples using a Bishop apparatus are detailed herein. Additionally, soil erosion function apparatus (EFA) tests were performed on selected cohesionless samples to investigate the threshold seabed stress ($\tau{}$cr) and scour rates for the use of sediment mobility potential assessment. The EFA test results are compared and discussed with empirical shields diagram and correlations.  This paper provides a thorough overview of the static and dynamic soil properties of the US Atlantic OCS cohesionless soils for offshore wind farm foundation design. Comparisons of the soil properties with those published for the soils in other regions also are included.}

	abstract		= {Saipem developed an industrialization process to carry out the offshore wind foundations final assembly stage aiming to achieve a compact and efficient work site able to deliver the high throughput needed for floating wind farms at gigawatt scale. This final assembly industrialization process, called Smart Yard (patent pending), applies a production line philosophy where the work is split among optimized workstations minimizing the duration of the operations, the space required, and the number of resources necessary with a positive impact on the project economics and timeline.  The Smart Yard production process approach it’s optimized for Saipem’s STAR1 semi-submersible design, and intended to be accommodated on a number of US ports (present and future) and it will contribute to the cost-efficiency necessary for floating wind to take off in US, while supporting the development of a American fabrication value-chain for floating wind. The Saipem’s STAR1 final assembly process has been split up in an exhaustive sequence of elementary tasks. Those tasks and the different tools and techniques available on the market to perform them have been analyzed to select the most appropriate ones and define the duration and methodologies applicable to each task.  The Smart Yard assembly process applied for STAR1 has resulted in the definition of typically 3- 4 workstations. A customized equipment shall handle parts alignment in combination with a real time laser alignment method ensuring a perfect fit. Dedicated access and fabrication towers fitted with the selected welding technologies and real time NDE shall minimize the joining time eliminating reworks. The handling philosophy rely on the use of SPMTs/skidding which results in a great flexibility and operations easiness.  The area required is minimized, and with no need for oversized cranes deployment, the facility can be installed on a temporary basis and easily relocated. Additionally, the technology content and tasks specialization allow for fast workforce training. This type of production philosophy opens the path for a serial and mass production plant development tailored on the floating foundation product category.}

	abstract		= {Hazards in the offshore environment can imperil successful energy operations, whether those operations are conventional, renewable, or for decarbonization. The expanding accessibility of data science and the advanced applications of machine learning (ML) models creates an opportunity to assess potential hazards and the infrastructure they impact. We present a use case demonstrating the combined application of published ML tools to U.S. federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, an actively explored region for offshore energy that is affected by variable metocean conditions and geologic processes contributing to potential hazards. This paper demonstrates the streamlined use of ML tools to illuminate potential cascading risk events posed by seafloor hazards to pipeline infrastructure, as well as the hypothesized fate and transport of released material in the event of a pipeline rupture. We apply an ML-informed submarine landslide susceptibility tool (ML-LSM) which analyzes spatial features including slope and sediment type using a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to produce a susceptibility map in addition to the Climatological and Instantaneous Isolation and Attraction Model (CIIAM), an advanced Lagrangian model to predict material transport based on typical metocean conditions. These models were applied to the Gulf of Mexico to produce spatial results based on the features respective to the seafloor and metocean environments. The Advanced Infrastructure Integrity Model (AIIM) tool, which uses big data and ML models including GBDT and artificial neural networks, was applied to provide a preliminary forecast for pipeline integrity. Intersections of submarine landslide susceptibility, potential for infrastructure integrity loss, and material transport are highlighted amongst the results, which are presented spatially. The combination of these models utilized ML analytics to provide multiscale insights into potential future risks to energy infrastructure. Results of AIIM, in corroboration with various reports, show most existing pipelines are forecasted to be operating past their original design life. The ML-LSM map indicates locations with high landslide susceptibility. Comparing the ML-LSM and AIIM results, we are able identify potentially vulnerable structures that are at greater risk, or those in areas with lower landslide likelihood that may be potential candidates for lifespan extension or retrofitting to support alternative energy strategies. The results of the CIIAM model are integrated to indicate material fate-and-transport complications in the event of infrastructure rupture. Areas of potential bias and recommendations for model tuning are also discussed.}

	abstract		= {The seafloor in the US Pacific OCS and EEZ is enriched to varying degrees in critical and economically important minerals such as nickel, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, REY (rare earth elements plus yttrium), titanium, vanadium, antimony, gold, and silver. These mineral deposits take the form of polymetallic nodules on the seabed, cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on seamounts and ridges swept clean of sediment accumulation, and seafloor massive sulfides formed by hydrothermal systems at geologic plate spreading centers and volcanic margins. Each of these mineral deposits form on or near the deep ocean seafloor where water depths are typically 4000 m to 5500 m and on the seamounts and volcanic arcs that rise from these depths. Commercial interest in deep sea mineral deposits and the potential for collecting or mining them began in earnest in the 1970s but has been heightened in the last 20 years as the international framework for developing these minerals in International Waters has matured that has coincided with forecasted rapid rising demand for minerals to supply energy and manufacturing needs for the green economy. Compilation reports published by academia, government, and private companies are reviewed to assemble data and assess the prospects for deep sea marine minerals in the US Pacific OCS and EEZ. Key compilations were made by the Circum-Pacific Council and USGS in the 1980s and 1990s. These, together with recent (2023) efforts by USGS to compile geochemical data from USGS affiliated marine research sampling cruises from the 1980s and 1990s, historical data maintained by NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and recent publicly disclosed results from ISA contractors are used to inform the known occurrence and prospectivity for polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and seafloor massive sulfides in the US Pacific OCS and EEZ.}

	abstract		= {Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) offer unique operational and maintenance (O\&M) challenges and opportunities compared to their fixed-bottom counterparts. Situated further from shore, FOWT benefit from stronger, more consistent winds, but this increased distance leads to longer travel times and harsher conditions, reducing accessibility. Traditional jack-up vessels become impractical in deeper waters. Additionally, the inherent motions of FOWT introduce complexity to maintenance strategies.  As wind turbine dimensions continue to grow, major component replacements (MCR) require heavier lifts at greater heights. The conventional MCR approach for semi-submersible FOWT is the tow-to-port strategy, which can be complex, time-consuming, and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to explore alternative onsite options.  This article introduces a novel floating-to-floating method for FOWT MCR, developed and numerically tested using a leading software for the dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems. The component to be replaced, also referred to as ``package'' below, is typically first removed from the wind turbine nacelle, and a replacement part is then re-installed. The method comprises: A motion-compensated offshore crane capable of lifting components and adjusting winch length based on the package relative distance from its target on the nacelle.  Horizontal control lines (tag lines) connected to the package base, passing through deflectors at the nacelle top, and linked to winches or capstans.  To ensure a safe package transfer between the offshore crane and the nacelle, relative motion should not exceed a few centimeters when the package lands onto the nacelle. Numerical analysis results confirm that this method enables accurate transfers with low tension in the tag lines.  This innovative approach promises to enhance the efficiency and safety of maintenance operations for floating offshore wind turbines, addressing the unique challenges posed by their remote locations and size.}

To improve on existing workflows, BP has enhanced its previous petroleum/process engineering-focused toolkit and has globally deployed a production system digital twin end-to-end; Reservoir, Wells, Plant and Export, for model-based surveillance and optimization.  The production system digital twin is a cloud-based system that connects sensor data from each asset's data historian to an equipment data model and first principle steady state simulation tools to create a reliable status of the well network and processing facilities. This facilitates multi-disciplinary collaboration and is remotely accessible by global teams.  The integrated digital twin has three modes of operation: monitoring, simulation, and optimization. In monitoring mode, the models are automatically updated hourly with real-time data and key simulation results collected and saved. These monitoring simulations provide virtual sensor output via bespoke algorithms, revealing information that either real sensors cannot measure or are not installed to measure. Engineers utilize what-if simulation or optimization mode to test scenarios and explore capacity increase options or analyze optimization potential.  This paper will feature three practical applications to demonstrate realized values. It will describe elements of the integrated digital twin models deployed in BP's Gulf of Mexico assets, and outline the challenges and lessons in maintaining and auto-calibrating the digital twin.}

A complete comprehension of topics such as displacements, reaction forces, bending moments and friction factors is commonly a result of investigations through geotechnical physical models. Although small-scale models are widely adopted due to lower costs, time spent and availability of lab facilities, full-scale modelling may achieve more realistic results, especially regarding pipe-soil interaction. Aiming to reliably reproduce the axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction behavior in Pre-Salt's typical soft marine clay profiles, southeastern Brazil, and improve knowledge, IPT (Institute for Technological Research of the State of Sao Paulo) designed and constructed, with Petrobras support, two large-scale Geotechnical testing steel tanks with complete infrastructure and a set of auxiliary systems. The lab facility was designed to meet the modeling requirements to represent the soft clays soils found on deep-waters of Santos Basin, and to operate autonomously, being divided in three main groups: (i) a soil transportation and homogenization system, (ii) a soil consolidation system and (iii) a cyclic axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction testing systems. Among the various experimental apparatus developed, the following stand out: (i) an automatic filling and emptying system, which takes water and soil into and out of the tanks; (ii) automatic servo controlled hydraulic mixers to prepare homogeneous clay slurries; (iii) a dual soil consolidation system using both vacuum preloading and surcharge loading methods, enabling the replication of predefined seabed shear strength profiles; and a (iv) fully-automated carriage capable of imposing large displacements to evaluate cyclic axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction. This paper presents aspects of the development of this novel laboratory facility and focuses on the requirements and experimental systems developed by IPT to reproduce, through physical modelling, axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction for soft clays, predominant soil type in the Pre-Salt area, southeastern Brazil. Commissioning tests, which validate the implemented systems, are presented in the end.}

	abstract		= {The use of rigid pipelines in underwater engineering projects is based on their proven robustness and extensive history of use in the oil and gas industry. However, market limitations and challenging schedules are offensive agents to this type of architecture that need to be mitigated and overcome to add flexibility to the project and optimize resources utilization.  One of the main limiting factors of the rigid pipeline-based underwater architecture is the connection with subsea equipment. Typically, this connection is made through rigid jumpers between a Pipeline End Termination (PLET) installed at the end of the flowlines and the connection point with the subsea equipment, usually a Subsea Christmas Tree or subsea equipment, such as manifolds or boosting units. In order for these jumpers to be properly connected, it is necessary for the pipeline and equipment to be already in place and for metrology to be performed: their positions must be measured, and tolerances determined before the jumper can be manufactured and installed.  As a common practice during the interconnection phase of the rigid pipe-based subsea architecture, it is necessary to perform precommissioning steps of the rigid pipeline, including flooding and hydrostatic testing, followed by metrology between the PLET and the Subsea Christmas Tree hubs. The manufacturing process of the rigid jumper that connects the rigid pipeline to the subsea equipment, including the final welding and testing is only performed after this metrology process. This takes a certain amount of time with direct impact on the critical path for the readiness of the subsea system of the project.}

In this context, the main objective of this study is to accurately predict significant wave heights, combining the results from numerical simulations and data-based models. The available data at a point in the Santos Basin, Brazil, was: 5 deterministic forecast models and 80 members from probabilistic forecast simulations and in-situ wave buoy measurement. Ensemble means and neural networks forecasts were calculated and compared to Hs forecast of individual deterministic models. Root mean square error was the chosen metric to compare the deterministic models and the data-driven forecasts. The results show ensemble means (EM) outperforming individual members for lead times higher than 24h. The neural networks forecast reduced even further the errors, especially for shorter lead times.}

	abstract		= {This study seeks to investigate the influence of backflow soil and punch-through phenomena on the bearing resistance profile of the Spudcan penetration. These factors have the potential to induce abrupt failures in jack-up barges during both installation and operation phases. A recently developed finite element technique called the Press Replace Technique (PRT) is being used to study this problem. The PRT has proven to be one of the most efficient techniques for assessing the stability of a Jack-up barge under the design vertical loads during installation and operation. This method ensures a satisfactory bearing capacity, an adequate embedded depth of a Spudcan foundation, and, consequently, a stable installation of a Jack-up barge. The study shows the main criteria and the basic assumptions to be considered in the finite element analysis using the PRT, including the modelling technique of the backflow phenomenon in case the surface layer is a clay soil. The study primarily focuses on double-layer soil conditions, particularly, the condition of stiff clay over soft clay and the condition of stiff clay over loose sand conditions, where Punch-Through of a Spudcan is more likely to occur. A practical case study analyzes a scenario where the Spudcan penetrates through a thick surface layer of soft clay over a layer of sand. The findings underscore the necessity of incorporating the backflow phenomenon in the numerical analysis, particularly in relation to the occurrence of punch-through. Furthermore, when considering double-layer with a surface clay layer, the results indicate that the bearing resistance of the surface layer is predominantly influenced by the type and thickness of the soil layer underneath.}

However, considering the significant capital cost involved in building new infrastructure, the proposition to reusing, or repurposing existing assets to transport and store hydrogen is becoming increasingly attractive.  This paper addresses the viability of reuse and repurpose of existing infrastructure like natural gas pipelines to transport hydrogen (pure or co-transport). This paper articulates the drivers behind repurposing infrastructure like pipelines and what it would take to convert its service from natural gas to hydrogen in a safe and economically viable manner. This will include identifying the opportunities (technical, economic, and societal) and more importantly the challenges; and how best the challenges can be addressed within the prevailing economic and regulatory environments. Although much has been written about repurposing infrastructure, a concise guideline on the steps to take to repurpose is absent, since there is no straightforward answer. Repurposing must take into consideration the process, technical, human safety factors, assess the technical suitability of the asset for managing hydrogen and includes business analysis, infrastructure technical viability followed by rigorous analysis and testing. This paper attempts to develop a road map that would enable a business / operator with a protocol they can utilize to make decisions on repurposing.}

The HDD length spanned approximately 2 km from Onshore Galeota to Nearshore Galeota, Trinidad. The chosen project location, connecting the offshore segment of the pipeline to the onshore Galeota Terminal in Trinidad, presented unique challenges that required innovative solutions. The project encountered several obstacles during execution, including the COVID-19 pandemic on offshore operations making it challenging to conduct key geotechnical surveys and mobilize assets. This resulted in the project making critical decisions on route selection, drill tooling selection, fluid properties and coating selection using geotechnical data from previous HDD projects completed close to Galeota Trinidad, without samplings from the actual proposed location.}

	abstract		= {1st End PLET initiation is a common method considered for offshore pipeline installation. The 1st End PLET helps in supporting a direct permanent hold back system without any other operations by secondary, vessels. However, there are some associated factors that limit the use of 1st End PLETs. These limiting factors include the complicated design and fabrication of a hinged system, the relatively large anchor forging loads and seabed features that limit the length of chain/wire length for initiation. These factors have a direct impact on the limiting sea-states for offshore installation which may result in long weather downtime.  Subsea7 has considered novel ideas to improve the sea-state for a scenario where the wire length has been restricted for a 1st end initiation PLET with a permanent hold back system. Subsea7 has investigated the use of a stretcher wire that has the capability of straining up to 25\% at very high loads without compromising the structural integrity of the initiation wire system. The stretcher wire was connected between two chain/wire segments for a hinged 1st end PLET installation. It has also been considered for a Stab and Hinge PLET initiation method. In both scenarios, there is an improvement in the limiting sea-state compared to the case using an initiation wire/chain without the ability to stretch.  This innovative method using a stretcher wire provides a damping effect in the initiation wire system which is highly beneficial. This damping effect reduces the peak stresses and strains that typically occur at the anchor forging section of a 1st end PLET/pipe interface during initiation. Furthermore, the stretcher wire does not have any limitation to use under any external hydrodynamic pressure. Hence, this selection could be beneficial for subsea operations at any water depth.  This paper will discuss and analyze the installation methods used and the screening for a suitable stretcher wire for given 1st end PLET initiation. The limitations and drawbacks that should be accounted before considering the use of stretcher wire for initiation will also be discussed.  Subsea7 has successfully installed a number of 1st end PLETs with such a stretcher wire. Some of these projects will be listed here. Finally, this paper will also introduce potential future developments that are being considered to further improve the PLET initiation sea-state by further dampening the 1st end PLET system.}

The selected sources reviewed and characterized to provide the input to the hydrodynamic analysis are the Lebanon Thrust Fault, two fault segments of the Cyprus Arc and the Evrona and Elat faults (Dead Sea Fault system).  Tsunami event due to Lebanon Thrust Fault impacts the Nile Delta and propagates into the Suez Canal with the formation of long sub waves with a maximum water level reached at Port Said after 2 hours and a half from the beginning of propagation.  Tsunami generated by seismic events due to major fault systems belonging to the Cyprus Arc affect Port Said with a maximum water level reached at about 3 hours and a half after the seismic event.  Finally, simulations developed considering as seismic source the Evrona Dead Sea Fault, located in the Gulf of Aqaba, reveal that a significant water level increase is observed along the entire Canal at about six hours from the beginning of the tsunamigenic event.}

In this laboratory study, we investigate the response of a dry Navajo sandstone specimen to constant-rate water injections under vertical loading up to 12 MPa and zero lateral strain conditions. Our measurements and analyses include identifying the heterogeneity features in the internal structure of the rock via X-ray imaging, the geochemical composition of rock minerals via XRD and XRF, the evolution of the axial load and deformations, and fluid pressure upon injection, and the full-field planar deformations on the rock surface through digital image correlation. The initial goal was to understand the fluid flow regimes ranging from diffusive flow to localization of fractures induced by water injection; however, the high permeability of the sandstone would require higher injection rates than the range available in the current pumping system. The results enhance our understanding of fluid flow and damage mechanisms in the near wellbore region, utilizing a multi-phase, multi-scale, and multi-sensor monitoring system to overcome the limitations of traditional single-sensor measurements.}

This study presents an artificial intelligence model developed to predict the cement slurries thickening time based on historical experimental data, along with the ability of the model to continue learning based on the flow of output results.  Collected data sets of different input parameters were gathered and studied to estimate cement thickening time. Based on statistical analysis, only five inputs (Pressure (psi), measured depth (ft),bottom hole circulating temperature (\textdegree{}F), retarder additive concentration (\%), and slurry density (ppg)) had a positive impact on the correlation coefficients between the inputs and target properties. A model was developed using Python programming language to predict the thickening time. The data was fed into the model to train and test the input factors impacting the target property using a neural network method.  The model expressed an integrated relationship between the training and validation data which resulted in an optimum learning performance revealed by a loss function plot. As a result, the scatter plot for prediction vs actual has illustrated the prediction of the thickening time with an average accuracy of 83\% confirmed by the model box plot. The model validation consisted of employing a set of data to predict the thickening time for more than 11 slurries with an average absolute error of 6\%.  Model implementation indicated that over 200 hours per month were saved due to reduced number of thickening time test iterations required to be run before executing the job which positively impacting operational efficiencies associated with cost, resource allocation, and investigation assessment. The outcome results from this model and the process used herein could be scaled up to consider other properties, i.e. ultra-sonic cement analyzer UCA, fluid loss, free fluid, etc.}

	abstract		= {Today many exploration, appraisal, and development well test operations are performed in new frontiers, remote locations, deepwater offshore environments, and complex gas-bearing reservoirs. Deepwater welltest and well cleanup operations are presenting unique challenges related to flow assurance aspects that are beyond the standard welltest playbook. Several failures and operational issues related to flow assurance such as the plugging of pipelines and/or tubing by wax or hydrates have hindered the interpretability of data, compromised well test objectives, significantly increased the total costs, or led to serious health safety and environmental (HSE) incidents. Several past experiences have shown that it is nearly impossible to perform a proper deepwater well test with achieving well test objectives without an appropriate test design, equipment selection and operations planning. The assessment and mitigation actions to reduce the risk of hydrate formation are of paramount importance in such welltest design activities.  Hydrate formation is one of the most common flow assurance issues during the well test and well cleanup operations in gas and gas-condensate reservoirs, particularly in deep-water offshore environments. Low water column temperature in deep water along the marine riser can cool down the produced fluids considerably. This in turn can trigger hydrate formation introducing significant challenges to the operations while increasing the risk of HSE incidents and therefore compromising the welltest objectives.  Well tests and well clean-ups are complex operations performed offshore today that involve multiple expertise across different domains and services including temporary surface well test package, landing string, and drill stem test (DST) string with specialized downhole tools and components or permanent completion. Therefore, the risk assessment of hydrate formation and plan of mitigation actions must be performed in line with the detailed welltest operation sequences and technical capabilities of the equipment used offshore. Today there are no definitive practical workflows available that would guide operators through the process of planning deepwater well test operations effectively with a detailed assessment of the risk of hydrate formation and mitigation plan.  During the course of past three years, over twenty-five gas well tests were successfully completed in deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments around the globe. This success is mainly driven by the application of hydrate studies performed with new-generation transient multiphase wellbore flow simulation software. Hydrate studies coupled with fine-scale reservoir models for well test design, enable the evaluation of hydrate formation risks and help operators develop mitigation actions. The selection of an appropriate hydrate inhibitor and optimization of the chemical injection system is essential to achieve the required chemical injection capabilities to prevent hydrate formation. Despite all the mitigation actions against hydrate formation, our experience has shown that rigorous monitoring and quick reaction to early detection of hydrate formation was instrumental in preventing several substantial problems. This paper describes an innovative approach and provides practical recommendations that can be used to assess the risk of hydrate formation and develop mitigation actions during the design stage of well tests. Besides, this paper highlights the results and lessons learned from the multiple welltest operations performed in recent years.}

The focus of this paper will be on a flexible input, multi-Kilowatt hour seabed battery system which builds on multiple recent and resident AUV demonstration projects, featuring battery and renewable energy powered docking stations with temporary and permanent underwater residency of AUVs for carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring and hydrocarbon leak detection.  The benefits of the system will be explored including enabling long term deployment of monitoring and surveillance equipment, AUV residency for inspection regimes and providing the interface from subsea equipment to surface communications.  The infield charging and communications station system will therefore allow AUVs to dock, recharge the AUV batteries, upload mission data and receive new mission parameters without requiring manual offshore intervention, with less reliance on carbon-intensive traditional vessels and less susceptibility to adverse surface weather conditions.}

	abstract		= {Sediment plumes are a key issue in assessing the environmental impact of seabed mining. The Metals Company carried out a pilot Nodule Collector test in the NORI-D license area in late 2022. The equipment test was closely monitored in the nearfield from the Allseas test mining vessel and in the far field from a dedicated monitoring vessel. The monitoring program was designed to quantify the concentration of sediment returned to the sea at a mid-water discharge point, as well as the sediment disturbed by the Prototype Collector Vehicle at the seabed. The monitoring efforts were aimed at providing baseline data as well as observing the concentration, movement and settling of the plume. All monitoring efforts were supported by numerical modelling, which was used to inform the best monitoring locations as well as the conditions expected during the testing of the collector vehicle.  Following a comprehensive planning phase, decisions on monitoring methods and equipment and their deployment were described in detailed SOPs for all field work to ensure consistency of all measurements. This included details of instrument configurations and deployment strategies for fixed and mobile monitoring platforms. However, complex field operations are almost impossible to plan down to the minute and a degree of flexibility is required to ensure optimal use of the campaign. The realized monitoring strategy reflected the basic guiding principles detailed in the SOPs adapted to logistical circumstances encountered in the field, This is particularly important to allow comparisons between different types of analyses, including the interpretation of analyses of individual water samples.  In this paper we will present the monitoring strategy and plan developed by DHI in collaboration with The Metals Company. We will also present the different components of the monitoring (mobile assets such as AUV/ROV), fixed stations (mooring lines and landers), water and sediment sampling that were used during the campaign. Recent experiences of tracking and observing plumes with acoustic instrumentation mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROV), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), static seabed landers, and oceanographic moorings will be presented.  Specifically, this presentation will discuss:The value of predictive modelling prior to the start of trials, with the objective of monitoring where significant plume was to be expectedHow differences between predictive modelling and real-time observations influenced short-term monitoring strategiesKey challenges related to instrument performance at extreme depths, mobile monitoring platforms, and simultaneous monitoring operations}

The remote location of the project poses logistical challenges in mobilizing to and operating in the region and is a significant cost driver. Historically, exploration campaigns mobilized large vessels from mainland Europe, the Americas, and Asia as this model works well when contemplating long duration and widely temporally spaced campaigns without the need to revisit. Moana Minerals, when considering these challenges determined a multi-year deep sea mining (DSM) exploration program conducted in such a remote location can be better optimized by the deployment of a smaller yet highly capable ``exploration optimized'' vessel that is dedicated to the task and is based full time in the Cook Islands.}

	abstract		= {Blending hydrogen with natural gas (H2-NG) in pipelines is one of the pragmatic solutions to lower carbon emissions from natural gas usage. This strategy entails incorporating a defined percentage of H2 into established NG networks. This work evaluates the potential of H2-NG blending in the Telfer Gas Pipeline (TGP) \textendash{} a part of the Western Australia transmission network. The effect of increasing H2 fraction on pressure profile, corrosion, and erosion along TGP was addressed.  The pipeline model was developed and validated using PIPESIM-Net software. The tested gas mixtures were calibrated with comparable studies, while the pipeline model was validated with the real operating conditions of TGP. Then, a thorough sensitivity analysis was performed, investigating the impact of varying H2 concentrations. The molar fraction of H2 in the gas mixture increased from 0\% to 80\%, with a 10\% step.  The inclusion of H2 substantially increased the pressure profile at both the TGP's mainline and delivery nodes (sinks). This rise in pressure resulted from notable reductions in both density and viscosity as the H2 fraction increased, contributing to decreased hydrostatic and frictional pressure losses along the pipeline, respectively. Thermodynamically, the compressibility factor reached unity when the gas composition contained 80\% H2. The heightened pressure in the pipeline caused increased corrosion rates, although the erosional velocity ratio exhibited a slight decrease with higher H2 content.  This analysis offers critical insights into the impact of H2 concentration on the system, providing a comprehensive assessment of potential risks and opportunities of H2-NG blending in transmission networks.}

One of the levers to carbon intensity reduction is to reduce direct emission from our portfolio and developing carbon sinks. Hence, the plan is to provide carbon storage services which would store equivalent of 50-100Mt/year of CO2 (TotalEnergies, 2023). To realize this objective, the logical step is by building capacity, in terms of skills and projects, to adapt to the new requirements of CO2 injection.  This ambition requires developing viable and sustainable surface and downhole equipment design which can meet the challenges of CO2 injection. Our focus is the case of CO2 that is transported in dense phase to the well and then injected into a highly depleted reservoir. Among the challenges associated with the dense phase CO2 injection into a depleted reservoir is the question of compatible completion strings, tubing connections and Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV); which form the primary well barrier, capable of handling potentially extreme low temperatures and rapid swings of temperatures associated with transient conditions of CO2.  Thus far, we have proposed credible load cases for completions stress analysis and developed a methodology / guideline for completions design in highly depleted reservoir. Today, we routinely apply it to every project in focus; to incorporate CO2 sequestration in the project development plans.  The results of this methodology clarify the specific need(s) for completions design and associated equipment qualifications for CCS applications in highly depleted reservoir environment.}

	abstract		= {Detailed geotechnical soil investigation surveys have been performed with onshore laboratory testing and interpretation to support the development of two wind farm sites, herein denoted Sites 1 and 2, in the Baltic Sea, offshore Poland. The two wind farms are planned to have about 50 wind turbines each with a total combined capacity of about 1.4 GW. Large diameter monopiles have been selected as the foundation concept with a target embedment length ranging from 25 m to 40 m.  The presence of an overconsolidated, high to ultra-high strength subglacial till layer, located at a depth of about 20 m to 40 m below seabed, is critical for the monopile foundation design. This layer presents significant challenges in terms of pile drivability, while also providing support to the monopile foundation design, both for the foundation capacity as well as the overall structural stability and integrity. The onshore laboratory testing included classification testing, static and cyclic strength testing, and testing to determine in-situ stress history and deformation properties. The interpretation included the integration of the geophysical data, geological, in-situ testing, and geotechnical laboratory testing to derive representative soil parameters for the subglacial till. X-ray scans showed signs of a complex geological process having taken place.  The subglacial till is heterogeneous, with sandy, gravelly clay alternating with homogenized deformed clay layers. It exhibits poor sorting, including intermittent sand layers and erosive contacts at various depths. Seismic reflections display varying amplitudes and facies characteristics, reflecting its intricate geological history linked to the last glaciation event. The presence of inclined layers, deformed laminations, and fractures help to confirm glaciotectonic origins. Key parameters for strength assessment are presented. The cyclic strength properties are compared to experience from literature offering insights into its cyclic loading behavior. The thorough investigation provides essential insights into the geotechnical properties of subglacial till at the two offshore wind farm sites, crucial for designing reliable monopile foundations in challenging marine environments.}

	abstract		= {GE has worked with Genesis to develop a semi-submersible Floating Offshore Substation (FOSS) solution (810MW, HVAC) for USA west coast with 1100-mter water depth. This concept design is based on the metocean data in Morro Bay Area, California (CA). The 1100-meter water depth and swell metocean (long period wave) give rise to extra technical challenges for floating OSS design, especially for the dynamic cable design.  The developed semi-submersible Floating Offshore Substation (FOSS) solution (810MW, HVAC) has been further validated and confirmed by one wave basin test performed at Oceanide (South-France) during July 2023.  As one part of one complete FOSS solution, how to transport and install (T\&I) FOSS at California west coast site has been investigated. This California site condition brings special challenges for the T\&I, such as the port infrastructure limitation, etc.  The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the recommended transportation and installation (T\&I) methodology for the FOSS, which includes the load-out, dry transport, discharge, mooring preset, wet tow, mooring hookup and dynamic cable installation.  The recommended T\&I methodology is mainly based on the fabrication base case, that the FOSS topside has been integrated onto the hull at the fabrication yard.  Based on the recommended T\&I methodology presented in this paper, it can be concluded that the GE FOSS (810MW, HVAC) can be transported from Asian fabrication yard to California west coast, and installed.}

	abstract		= {Amid the global energy expansion, where diverse energy sources are needed to meet rising demand, minerals like nickel, cobalt, and lithium become imperative for the renewable energy supply chain. While these minerals are almost exclusively mined from land, when utilizing offshore industry expertise, these critical minerals become accessible by deep sea minerals harvesting of the seabed, where vast reserves of such minerals remain untapped. This paper highlights a test of the feasibility of side-by-side mooring for offloading such minerals in the offshore environment. The study employs frequency and time domain simulations to evaluate the operation of a two-vessel system. The setup involves a production vessel with dynamic positioning (DP) and a transport vessel moored side-by-side, connected with mooring lines and fenders. Simulations span various wave heights, periods, and directions. Critical metrics like line tensions, fender loads, and vessel motions are then contrasted against predefined criteria, pinpointing scenarios where the operation could be viable.  The simulations revealed that the primary determinant of operability is line tensions. Factors such as the direction of incident waves, wave period, and the shielding effects from the DP vessel also significantly influence outcomes. Particular care should be taken to manage the drafts of the vessels to prevent thruster impact on the transport vessel, which would elevate line loads. The DP settings of the production vessel should also be tuned to account for the vessel moored alongside.  Additionally, the paper discussed further work needed to establish guidance on the approach and departure of the transport vessel. The maneuvering characteristics of the transport vessel will be pivotal during its approach and departure, especially given the operations' remote open water location and unpredictable tug support availability as a result thereof.}

Here, we adapt and apply a promising framework \textendash{} originally proposed by the present authors for the prediction of wave conditions on the European North West Shelf \textendash{} to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The approach consists of using an attention-based long short-term memory recurrent neural network to learn the temporal patterns from a network of available buoy observations, that is then combined with a random forest based spatial nowcasting model, trained on reanalysis data, to develop a complete framework for spatiotemporal prediction for the basin. By way of demonstration, the new method is applied for the short-range prediction of wave conditions up to 12 hours ahead, using in-situ wave observations from the sparse network of National Data Buoy Center locations as an input, with the corresponding spatial mapping learned from the physics-based Met Office WAVEWATCH III global wave hindcast. The full spatiotemporal forecast system is assessed using independent measurements in the vicinity of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, previously unseen by the machine learning model. Results show that accurate real-time, rapidly updating wave predictions are possible, available at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional physics-based methods. The success of the approach, combined with the flexibility of the framework, further suggest its utility in related metocean challenges. While still at an early stage of development into a fully relocatable capability, it is intended that this contribution provides a foundation to stimulate a series of subsequent efforts to help support improved offshore planning and workability \textendash{} including (but not limited to) applications linked with better resolving spatial variability across renewable energy sites, predicting ocean current regimes in the proximity of oil \& gas platforms, as well as informing adaptive sampling strategies conducted by autonomous vessels \textendash{} where the adoption of such a machine learning approach, that can be run on a laptop computer, having the potential to revolutionize data-driven decision-making by the industry.}

	abstract		= {On top of the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean lie trillions of polymetallic nodules that contain many of the metals needed for transitioning to a low carbon future. In 2021, the pre-protype seafloor nodule collector ‘Patania II’ performed successful in-situ trials at 4,500 m (>14,750 ft) water depth. The trials entailed collecting nodules using a hydraulic collector head and were complemented by an extensive environmental monitoring program. The gathered results will feed directly into a Seafloor Nodule Collector (SNC) and collector head design iteration study aimed at further improving performance. This paper presents the initial results of the Seafloor Nodule Collector improvement study using Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}). The scope of the study is twofold, firstly the collector head design is improved and secondly, the wake behind the SNC is minimized. The combination of field experience and data with high-fidelity {CFD} simulation technology will result in a reliable impact prediction of the design improvements to be done. This paper will provide a useful methodology and reference for further design improvements for seafloor nodule collector vehicles, not only to enhance the hydraulic performance but also to reduce the environmental impact of deep-sea mining operations. Key performance indicators are being identified that contribute to sediment plume dispersion.  First, with respect to the collector head, the collector performance is influenced by its geometry, the jet- and surrounding water inflow and forward speed. The combination of these factors will create a pressure profile on the seafloor, which allows nodule pick-up and hydraulic transport. The trials showed that the balance between performance, robustness and unwanted water/sediment intake is impossible to determine in lab conditions. The in-situ gathered performance data, like pick-up efficiencies related to jet velocities, was used to validate {CFD} simulations and establish a reliable collector head numerical model. Based on measurement data and {CFD} results, a seafloor pressure profile base-case has been defined. A step-by-step approach was followed by simulating several modifications to the collector head geometry, by varying the jet flow and by applying recirculation of the discharge water to the suction head. This was carried out while consistently maintaining the base-case pressure profile as a reference. The modified numerical model shows that it is feasible to re-circulate and re-use a significant amount of sediment-laden jet water, while maintaining the pick-up performance and reliability. The set-up allows controllability on the amount of re-circulation. The obtained re-circulation results in a significant increase of sediment density, in combination with a decrease of diffuser outlet flow. This will improve the diffuser discharge characteristics and further reduce the sediment plume and associated environmental impact.  Secondly, a {CFD} study for wake modelling has been performed on Patania II as a base case. An optimization study was performed, which involved improving the SNC geometry and diffuser location with the aim to reduce the turbulence behind the vehicle and consequently reduce local sediment dispersion and related environmental impact.}

	abstract		= {In geotechnical earthquake engineering, shear wave velocity (VS) is one of the most important parameters. Several empirical correlations have been developed to estimate VS based on in situ tests, such as P-S logging tests and piezocone penetration tests (PCPTs), and soil properties determined both offshore in a field laboratory and onshore in a geotechnical laboratory. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning have been the subject of intense media hype and therefore it was deemed appropriate to develop a deep-learning algorithm (DLA) to predict VS and compare its performance with conventional empirical methods of determining VS. A database of 11 sites in the Bay of Campeche with in situ measurements of VS using P-S logging and 8 clay soil parameters, including in situ measurements of net cone resistance (qnet), water content (w), submerged unit weight (g’), void ratio (eo), undrained shear strength (su), effective overburden pressure ($\sigma{}${'}vo), over consolidation ratio (OCR), and plasticity index (Ip), was used to train a DLA and develop empirical equations based on multiple regression analysis (MRA) to predict VS. The accuracy of the results (i.e., how close the predicted VS values are to the in situ measured VS values) illustrates the great potential DLA has to become another class of computational tool to predict VS, and DLA has the advantage that it can be continuously updated as new data become available. The DLA was found to outperform MRA when the three input variables are measurements of qnet, w, and $\sigma{}${'}vo and when the eight clay soil parameters are used as input parameters. The results suggest deep learning has the potential to overcome prediction limitations associated with linear or polynomial trends and adjust to discrete variabilities in soil conditions. They also reveal potential applications for deep learning in reducing uncertainty in the characterization of areas with complex soils without drastically increasing the scope of a site investigation.}

	abstract		= {In offshore construction, geotechnical risk assessment of pile installation during the preparatory phase is of major importance. Pile driveability analyses are part of these preparations and provide, primarily, insights into the relation between hammer blow count, driving stresses, and the static soil resistance during driving (SRD). In case the total weight of the ``pile driving system" (i.e. the combination of pile, follower and hammer) exceeds the SRD, a phenomenon referred to as "pile run" or "drop fall'' might occur. Usually, at this point in wave equation analysis software, no hammer blow count is calculated until a depth is found where the SRD increases sufficiently to support the weight of the pile driving system again. For many (offshore) projects, with ever increasing weight of piles and hammers, the consequences of pile run to equipment and foundations could be significant. Moreover, once offshore, options for mitigation are limited or are met with high costs and/or significant delays. This paper elaborates on a model that was developed to predict the extent of pile run and velocity of pile and hammer during a drop fall. The model includes an approach that allows for assessment of effects from liquefaction during high velocity pile runs. A correction for strain rate dependent shear strength is also included. The model was validated by means of field observations of multiple controlled pile run events during construction of an offshore wind farm. More recently, pile run field observations from a monopile installation project became available to the authors, for which the model also proved satisfactory. The observed and analyzed pile run for this specific case is also reported. Use of the model provides insight into the extent of pile run and could provide a basis for assessment of mitigating measures. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine which model parameters are key and what uncertainty bandwidth in pile run predictions should be taken into account.}

One of the key storage differences between liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen is the key advantage that liquid hydrogen has a higher density than compressed hydrogen in storage. Relative to compressed hydrogen, more compact containment could be used. At the marine loading facility, means of recovering or reliquefying the hydrogen boil-off gas could be present, accommodating one of the significant downsides of transportation of hydrogen as liquid.  Static storage has its set of issues, but transportation can be more demanding. Long range marine transportation puts significant constraints on the size of the hydrogen containers. However, marine transportation of liquid hydrogen may not have a means of recovering the boil-off gas.  Key decision points distinguishing compressed hydrogen gas and liquid hydrogen are presented. Additionally, options for on-board refrigeration and use of boil-off gas are also discussed.  The presentation provides an introduction to hydrogen storage and transportation and the impacts of using liquid hydrogen during storage and transportation vis a vis compressed hydrogen gas, as presented in a series of graphics and charts. This allows the session participant to understand the key issues with onshore storage and marine transportation of hydrogen.}

	abstract		= {In this paper, the main findings and developments pertaining to the Gentle Driving of Piles (GDP) method are presented, addressing various aspects of monopile installation. GDP introduces an innovative vibratory installation method for tubular (mono)piles, utilizing simultaneous low-frequency axial and high-frequency torsional vibrations to enhance the pile installation performance, while curbing underwater noise emissions during driving. To support the earliest development of the GDP method a multi-fold research programme has been carried out, including laboratory experiments, field testing, and advanced numerical modelling. The first field tests at the Maasvlakte II site (Port of Rotterdam, The Netherlands) successfully demonstrated the use of GDP in sandy soil in terms of (enhanced) installation as well as post-installation response to lateral cyclic loading. Furthermore, numerical modelling work was undertaken, addressing the aspects of drivability, vibro-acoustics and lateral response to cyclic loading. This paper provides novel insights into sustainable monopile installation, addressing challenges related to installation performance, lateral loading response, and vibro-acoustics. GDP emerges as a propitious solution for future offshore monopile installation, contributing to the ambitious goals of the offshore wind sector.}

	abstract		= {A comparison assessment of lateral buckle (LB) formation among three typical buckle mitigation devices (sleeper, distributed buoyancy modules (DBM), and residual curvature method (RCM)) commonly considered in the design of high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) flowlines is carried out by adopting a probabilistic approach based on Virtual Anchor Spacing Finite-Element (VAS FE) modeling to assess buckle initiation reliability. The pros and cons of each device are detailed, the critical stochastic parameters and deterministic parameters for the buckle formation associated with each device are identified, and a probabilistic assessment via a case study is carried out using the three mitigation devices for a subsea deep-water HPHT production flowline.  The probabilistic assessment of pipeline lateral buckling includes the following: (1) Calculation of the critical buckling force (CBF) and its probability density function for both engineered and rogue buckles based on deterministic and stochastic parameters via Monte-Carlo simulation and design of experiments (DOE); (2) Determination of the tolerable VAS by FE analyses for both engineered and rogue buckles to satisfy the design criteria; (3) Positioning of the engineered buckles along the flowline through a reliability analysis using BUCKFAST.  The analysis results indicate that the stochastic parameters that control the buckling formation are different for each of the three mitigation methods. Comparison of the three methods showed that the RCM option had the most significant impact on reducing the CBF due to the influence of the pipe/soil lateral breakout friction factor while the DBM option had the least significant impact, with the highest CBF among the studied mitigation devices. Results also show that some of the stochastic parameters do not have significant effects on the CBF for each considered mitigation device and therefore could be treated as deterministic parameters in future analyses. The competition between the CBF of rogue buckles along the curve section and the trigger CBF distribution is the key parameter when comparing the different mitigation methods. Sleeper and DBM options may not satisfy the LB design criteria in some cases when using the deterministic approach, especially for a rough seabed profile along the route, but may lead to a solution when using a probabilistic assessment. RCM has the advantages of a lower CBF and the lowest cost among the three mitigation methods, which means the RCM is a cost-effective lateral buckle mitigation solution for subsea HPHT pipelines.}

For the existing LFTV mooring system, the line tension is highly dynamic. It can increase exponentially as the offset of the floater increases and the mooring line is tightened to its full physical length under extreme wind and wave loading. This causes significant challenges in mooring system design particularly for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) in shallow water of 50\textasciitilde{}100m depth. Another challenge is that the existing catenary mooring system typically has a large footprint on the seabed which may have negative impacts on the marine environment.  In this paper, a new fixed tension mooring theory of "Length-Varying Tension-Fixed'' (LVTF) is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the existing mooring systems. Based on the new mooring theory, novel LVTF mooring configurations are developed for shallow water FOWT applications. Discussions are given on the mooring system restoring force for the novel LVTF mooring concept in comparison with existing catenary mooring. A simplified two-line system is used to illustrate the new mooring theory. Conceptual design of a three-line single shared anchor (SSA) LVTF mooring system is performed and numerical analyses are conducted for a semi-submersible platform supporting the IEA 15 MW wind turbine in shallow water. The results show that the novel ultra-small footprint SSA LVTF mooring concept is highly feasible for station-keeping of the FOWTs. It provides a highly cost-effective and environmental-friendly solution with improved safety and efficiency to the mooring challenges for shallow-water FOWTs. The next step is to conduct proof-of-concept model tests and prototype pilot tests to gain further insights and validate the novel LVTF mooring system conceptual design.}

	abstract		= {Floating wind turbine structures are subjected to complex fatigue damage resources, such as wave dynamic, blade motion, turbine vibration, wind turbulence, structure vibration and so on. A study of a semi-submersible wind turbine structure has revealed that the load from wind turbine significantly affects the fatigue behavior of the structure. However, how the load is comprised and how impacts fatigue life is unknown. Lately developed fully coupled time domain global analysis are capable of getting the time history of wind turbine tower bottom load. A study is performed to analyze the load the get the components of the loads. To get fatigue life of the whole structure, a complete structure model instead of hydro model is required. Due to the complication of the fully coupled time domain structural analysis, it is required to develop a methodology for coupling wind and wave impact on the fatigue life of the structure. In this study, time domain wind turbine load is used to compute the fatigue life due to wind and spectral fatigue method is used to computer fatigue life caused by wave. Then the fatigue damages were combined and compared to give suggestions for the future floating wind turbine structures.}

	abstract		= {Recently, the offshore wind industry is transitioning from the fixed-bottom in shallow waters to the floating in deep waters. This shift requires station-keeping anchors to stabilize turbines. Maximizing the cost-effectiveness and installation efficiency of anchor foundations is critical for project success. Suction anchors offer an efficient installation method by creating an underpressure to penetrate the seabed without noise from hammering like driven pile anchors. This foundation concept, well-established in the oil and gas industry, holds promise for floating offshore wind applications. Traditionally, the top cap is fixed on the suction anchor after installation to provide a sealed condition inside for better vertical holding performance. However, in the case of a catenary mooring system in soft clay, where horizontal loads dominate, the conventional fixed top cap may not be necessary. Instead, a retrievable top cap can be designed, offering cost savings and ensuring full embedment of the anchor in the seabed, enhancing its capacity, and mobilizing more soil in deep areas. This study presents a series of numerical modelling to investigate the horizontal capability of the suction anchors in clay with retrievable top caps. Comprehensive numerical simulations were performed, which were validated first against the existing studies in literatures for traditional suction anchor with fixed top cap. A parametric study was then carried out to assess the effects of the retrievable top cap length, anchor length to diameter ratio (L/D), padeye location, and loading angle on the anchor horizontal capacity. Consistent with the existing studies, the failure mechanism of horizontally loaded suction anchor change with the padeye location, which transforms from a rotation failure to horizontal translation failure as the padeye location increase from seabed to around 0.6L (anchor length) and provides the highest horizontal capacity, although it should be noted that the padeye location is also affected by the loading angle. For the anchor with retrievable top cap, almost the same horizontal capacity was observed when the L/D ratio is larger than 1. In addition, when the retrievable top part extends to upper part of anchor, a higher capacity factor can be obtained due to the increased embedment and the mobilization of deep soil. Compared with the anchor with fixed top cap, the optimum padeye location of anchor with retrievable top part will also change to a shallower depth at around 0.5L.}

	abstract		= {This paper evaluates technologies and available methods for the surveillance of flow in subsea CO2 injection systems, going from the subsea infrastructure to the injection wells, into the reservoir, and then back to the seafloor. Considerations and provisions required in the subsea system to accommodate certain surveillance technologies are highlighted. In this paper, the potential path taken by CO2 molecules are followed through a subsea storage system, with leak detection and plume surveillance in mind.  Feasibility and opportunities for using monitoring methods and leak detection technologies were assessed by utilizing an assessment matrix which summarises the various advantages and disadvantages of plume monitoring technologies and leak detection methods. The following aspects were assessed for each technology: 1. Technical feasibility; 2. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and development required; 3. Impact of the solution on the subsea system (e.g. field architecture, power and communication); 4. Relative costs; 5. Schedule (e.g. added risk due to development required).  Leak detection methods having unknown efficacy and limited research in CO2 applications were screened out. Those methods which have been field tested for CO2 service or currently under lab testing were advanced to a second stage of screening by product specifications to further consider their integration into the subsea injection system design. Passive acoustic technology was found to be the best suited for detection across subsea infrastructure as it covers a desirable detection radius at the lowest cost. Screening of plume monitoring methods showed benefits and drawbacks of each method evaluated; the review concluded that different technologies should be used at different stages of a subsea CCS project. Near well bore, CO2 migration monitoring can be performed using Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) as it yields a high-resolution image in the vicinity of the well. When the plume eventually outgrows VSP's radius of investigation, a sparse acquisition strategy can later be used to verify conformance of reservoir model's plume migration at strategic locations. Finally, leak detection tools such as an AUV with side scan sonar and a chemically degraded trigger and beacon could be used for leakage from the reservoir through the seabed and legacy wells respectively.  This paper provides a novel integrated view of CO2 escape paths, bringing together topics around CO2 leak detection from subsea injection equipment, sub-surface plume monitoring and leakage from reservoir through the seabed. The results of this research can benefit CCS projects in the concept phase influencing the design of subsea infrastructure to accommodate monitoring methods, thus guiding technology and risk assessments to support a Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) plan.}

	abstract		= {Exploration and exploitation of deep space and the deep oceans has powered much technological progress. With their extreme operating environments, these two remote and hostile domains have posed many challenges and has produced many solutions. The study of each of these extreme environments has significantly enhanced our understanding of the other, and the technologies that enable prospecting and extracting resources in one environment can often be adapted for use in the other. For both deep space and deep ocean, there is much to be learned from other sectors such as the medical industry as well. For example, medical imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans resemble the non-destructive testing techniques used in space and deepwater energy business. Similarly, robotic surgery is analogous to Mars Rovers and remotely operated vehicles used under water, and remote patient monitoring for more personalized and effective healthcare is comparable to the data analytics and machine learning used for proactive health monitoring in deep space and deep ocean. Digital transformation has been impacting all industries, and deep space and deep ocean are no exception. Digital transformation has three primary foundations: data-digital information; analytics-using the data to make better decisions, faster; and connectivity-data exchange between humans, machines, and devices. Various technologies enable and cut across these domains including sensors, cloud computing, edge analytics, automation and robotics, {3D} printing, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence all underlain and enabled by accessible, affordable, and reliable energy. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of such technologies at intersections between deep space and deep ocean. It will also document how the deep space and deep oceans hey have learned from each and have also leveraged advances in other sectors, principally medical and healthcare.}

	abstract		= {In wind turbine design, various critical aspects demand attention, including wind turbine design, assessment of floater structure, and optimization of the mooring system. Turbine designers prioritize control system optimization, relying on predicting responses like power generation and nacelle accelerations. Evaluating floater structure involves motion responses and loads on interface positions, like the tower base and mooring fairleads. The latter is crucial for positioning system optimization. These considerations often necessitate a comprehensive simulation of the entire system.  This paper conducts a comparative study of outputs of wind turbine, motion performances of the floater, and tensions of the mooring lines, involving various simulations using different mooring models, exploring both frequency and time domains. In the frequency domain, it begins with hydrodynamic analysis using equivalent springs and proceeds to a statistical analysis with a catenary mooring line model. Emphasizing time domain analysis, the paper extensively compares results from coupled analysis with a quasi-static catenary mooring model and a dynamic finite element mooring model. The wind turbine and floater models are kept identical, encompassing three power generation design load cases and two parked cases. The assumption is that the quasi-static approach can significantly reduce coupled analysis time, prompting an examination of its accuracy for the mentioned design focuses.  The conclusion reveals that, overall, the results for wind turbines and the tower\textemdash{}such as power generation, nacelle accelerations, and tower base moments\textemdash{}are very similar using two different mooring models in time domain analysis. Regarding floater motions, both approaches yield comparable results in the wave frequency range, but the quasi-static model tends to overpredict low-frequency responses. This conservative tendency affects global performance prediction more than structure assessment, as the latter mainly relies on wave frequency responses. Fairlead tension statistics show similar outcomes, but the power spectrum density indicates that the quasi-static mooring line may miss dynamic aspects. For capacity checks, the quasi-static approach remains valid, while it's recommended to use the dynamic FEM mooring line model for fatigue checks. A simplified approach may still be practical to streamline analysis for design iterations.}
