	abstract		= {During the hydraulic fracturing process, fracturing fluid leads to excessive frictional losses within the casing and formation which can be impediment to effectiveness of the operations and may result in screenout. Total pressure losses during hydraulic fracturing include wellbore pressure losses in pipe and the near wellbore pressure losses that includes both perforation and formation tortuosity losses. Wellbore friction pressure losses can be determined experimentally using flow loop test at different friction reducer concentrations and flow rates. Practically, fracturing engineers need to estimate and monitor the wellhead pressure and total friction losses during the operation and adjust the fluid, proppant, and friction reducer concentrations during the job. In this study, physics augmented data-driven models are used to predict the pressure losses in pipe using the flow loop test results and the well head pressures and total friction losses. Total friction losses used are based on field data of hydraulic fracturing stages from several wells. The flow loop test is modeled for specific friction reducer types at different concentrations and flow rates. The process of this model relies on analyzing the data obtained from the tests and establishing a correlation between the concentrations of the friction reducers, flow rate and their corresponding pressure losses. The second part is the modeling total pressure losses using field data considering fluid properties and the modeled lab results. Modeling approach incorporates all the key parameters such as fluid properties, proppant concentrations, friction reducer concentrations, slurry rates, perforation (Diameter and Density) and formation characteristics to accurately predict the frictional losses. Both models are tested using validation data. Outcome of the total friction pressure loss model and the forecasted wellhead pressure results exhibited a close agreement between the predicted and the recorded pressure values, indicating that the results can be used in actual field operations. This approach provides valuable information for optimizing hydraulic fracturing design and improving operational practices to minimize the down time. Utilization of the flow loop tests results eliminates the need for repetitive experiments, enabling parametric studies and sensitivity analysis and thus leading to more efficient operations. This unique approach, using the combination of physics-based and data-driven methodologies, represents a major step in predicting pressure losses in hydraulic fracturing operations. Integration of these models not only enhances understanding of the physical processes and the causalities, but also provides practical solutions for improving overall operational efficiency of the process.}

	abstract		= {Deepwater Emergency Pipeline Repair Systems (EPRS) are a suite of dedicated equipment manufactured, tested, and stored for the full life of the pipeline(s) in readiness to quickly perform a repair in the event of damage to the pipeline occurring. The requirement, design, manufacture, and storage of these systems carry Commercial and Technical challenges.  An overview of an EPRS will first be provided, followed by a review of the associated Commercial Challenges. Following this an outline of the Technical Challenges and Technical Drivers (decisions made by the design team which drive the direction of the system design) are discussed. Finally, three pipeline repair system case studies will be presented.  The requirement for an EPRS can range from it being a legislative requirement, a governmental license requirement, a commercial, reputational and environmental consideration, a requirement of the pipeline operators insurers, all focused on limiting loss of oil and gas transport volume should a breach of pipeline integrity occur. Considerations are often aided by detailed Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies and can be supported by a pipeline operator consortium to share costs in a given geographical region.  The Technical Challenges are external factors, generally fixed parameters such as pipeline diameter, operating pressure or environment, and are not readily influenced by the EPRS designer. The EPRS Technical Drivers must accommodate all aspects of the pipelines performance envelope, but can be delivered by a range of different solutions optimised, technically and commercially, to fulfilling the specified scope. These drivers will be described further in this paper along with respective, technical, and commercial options.  This paper addresses three EPRS solutions that have been built: one deployed in West Africa, one currently stored in North West Australia in readiness for a repair and one built and tested for the Black Sea region.  This overview of the key challenges associated with a repair system, and how these have been solved on the three EPRS case studies, will provide valuable information to pipeline operators considering a Deepwater EPRS solution.}

	abstract		= {The concept of digital twin has evolved over the years, from a product-oriented approach to an asset-oriented one. However, this shift in scope has also brought challenges and confusion for owners and stakeholders, who may have different expectations and requirements for a digital representation of their physical assets. In this paper, we propose the term 'digital avatar' to describe a digital asset that enhances the capabilities of a real asset, rather than replicating it. The ‘Digital Avatar’ can be seen as a digital extension of the asset, providing additional capabilities and insights that cannot be available in the physical realm.  Based on our experience and ongoing digital products, we constructed a framework to summarize the foundational technologies and concepts behind implementing a ‘digital avatar’ for an Oil and Gas production facility. These technologies have been categorized according to their purpose and laid out on an implementation timeline for greenfield projects. The main products we used as reference to build the Framework are also briefly presented to illustrate how this framework can support design, asset lifecycle management and performance optimization. This framework can help owners and stakeholders to align their objectives and priorities for developing and implementing digital avatars, as well as to evaluate their benefits and limitations.}

	abstract		= {Floating wind energy is a very promising source of energy, with governments across the globe embarking on ambitious plans to tap into wind energy offshore over the coming decades. There are clear advantages of offshore wind over onshore, such as higher sustained wind speeds and more locations for new developments, including deep water (i.e., water depths exceeding 200 ft). We performed a concept development study and preliminary analysis to test the feasibility of a proposed floating offshore wind spar concept using an innovative steel-concrete-steel ``sandwich'' composite system, with emphasis on efficient, cost-effective fabrication for a low Capital Expenditure (CapEx). This type of composite modular system has been successfully utilized and implemented into both safety-related nuclear facilities for use as containment structures and multi-story commercial structures as lateral force resisting core walls. We developed our spar concept design considering properties of the 5 MW and 15 MW NREL wind turbine available in public domain. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an innovative construction method to lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) support structures by utilizing local resources and existing infrastructure. This approach allows for modular and horizontal fabrication and assembly of a hull system that utilizes exterior steel ``face'' plates that act as permanent formwork and reinforcing steel to an inner concrete core \textendash{} where the faceplates are anchored to the concrete using steel anchors (shear studs or similar) and to each other using steel ties (round bar being the most common type of tie) that are typically welded to the faceplates. The resulting structure behaves similarly to proven concrete spar designs but can be constructed in a more expedited and more economical way compared to any other hull system capable of supporting large wind turbines and associated infrastructure. A steel-plate composite (or SC) construction methodology for spar hulls has several advantages compared to traditional hull construction, with one of the key benefits being an accelerated construction timeline due to being able to fabricate individual steel sub-modules in a controlled environment. These sub-modules are then interconnected into larger steel modules in a planned sequence horizontally over the length of the spar, with concrete placement occurring as the larger steel modules are completed. Similar concrete spar structures are typically built in a vertical arrangement using labor intensive and time-consuming slip forming methodologies requiring specialized dry dock facilities. An SC spar system constructed as described would also be better suited for local (North American) port infrastructure and shipyards to be able to fabricate and assemble. In our study, we ran preliminary calculations using first principles to estimate the dimensions and weights of the SC spar system. Once detailed sizing analysis of the platform is performed, design parameters such as wall thickness and weight can be further optimized. Additional studies and testing shall be performed at a later stage to improve the maturity of this concept.}

	abstract		= {This paper is a critical review of the application of the apposite brownfield total equipment care (TEC) principles and concepts largely contributory to the higher rotating equipment reliability and availability figures in the Bonga Deepwater operation. The approach defines how the performance of an ageing fleet of rotating machinery susceptible to myriads of production challenges including changing production fluids chemistry, reservoir pressure decline, equipment obsolescence and reliability reduction of ancillary equipment, supply chain disruptions effect of COVID \textendash{} 19 and its aftermath and others has been unlocked in a cost-effective manner to support the bottom-line business aspirations and achieve 1 billion barrels milestone. This paper is one of a series of Bonga themed papers proposed for OTC 2024.  The Bonga field journey to One Billion Barrels started with the launch of the Bonga Business Improvement Plan (BBIP) in 2016 with keen focus on improving on four (4) critical systems per year through End-to-End system reliability improvement, Asset register update, Reliability centered maintenance, Critical Sparing reviews, Surveillance refresh and Preventive Maintenance Optimization. Key strategies deployed are: Embedding Proactive Technical Monitoring (PTM) to aid in early identification and mitigation of threats prior to becoming big issues, by leveraging on technology tools such as Exception Based Surveillance (EBS), SmartConnect, Plant Information, Solar InSight, and System-1 amongst others, Deepening Failure Investigations by deploying Causal Reasoning methodology across business (including HSSE type events) to understand root causes and systemic issues, and driving Maintenance Efficiency, capacity \& capability building through strong collaboration with major rotating equipment manufacturers during planning and execution of major overhauls, utilizing onsite workshop and corporate workshop onshore for major maintenance activities not limited to valve overhauls, electric motor repairs, and pumps, and improved execution strategies resulting in optimized maintenance costs.  With our Proactive Threat Management approach, daily surveillance, strong collaboration with equipment OEMs during planning of major equipment overhauls, improved execution strategies and execution efficiencies, Bonga {FPSO} have been able to achieve significant improvement in plant availability of \textgreater{}95\%, reliability \textgreater{}96\%, and significant reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions through reduction of flares and fuel emissions, which has overall contributed to the 1 billion barrels export milestone achieved.  This paper presents the benefit of digitalization, robust Asset Management processes and competence development as key enablers to improved plant and equipment Reliability, Availability \& Utilization in any production facility.}

	abstract		= {A novel type of Chemistry based Autonomous Inflow Control Devices (Chemical-AICDs or C-AICDs) is introduced with the capability of restricting unwanted fluids based on chemically altering the fluid path structure in response to surrounding fluids. These devices are completely viscosity and density independent and don't require any intervention for water shutoff, resulting in saving time and cost during life of well. We discuss design elements, optimization, testing and evaluation methods of a selected configuration of the C-AICD.  C-AICD construction includes ported funnel and multi-core ball. As part of multi-core ball design, novel inorganic coating processes are synthesized and optimized to create multilayer coatings that have strong interlayer bonding to provide sealing integrity and controlled dissolution to facilitate uniform change of diametrical positions of the ball. The ported funnel design is optimized using Computer Aided Design and {3D} printed to confirm fit-form with the multi-core ball at various operational positions. The C-AICD flow performance was evaluated by a custom flow calculator based on orifice theory. Initial Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations ({CFD}) was carried out on one configuration of the ICD assembly. This calculator will be calibrated through {CFD} and function tested in a flow loop to validate flow performance and compatibility with system.  While advanced completion technology is created to enhance well performance, it is often more complex in design and field installation and comes at a higher cost than existing field-proven technologies. The revolutionary C-AICD design allows applications for oil production in fields while being sustainable, cost effective and efficient. The C-AICD incorporates a time and environment trigger selective water/oil dissolvable mechanism on thin coatings applied on a ball, formulating a mechanism for the world's first chemically configurable adaptive ICD. Novel methods and configurations to build a C-AICD using the dissolvable ball coatings concept packaged in a ported funnel are discussed. The time/environment dependent selective dissolution changes the diametrical position of the ball in the funnel changing flow port area available for inflow. Preliminary device efficiency and performance optimization of system was carried out through analytical flow calculation using physics based mathematical models. Study revealed the relationship between flow-rate, velocity, and pressure drop across C-AICD. This ensures a design standard for appropriate selection and sizing for efficient system performance. Individual elements like multi-core ball materials and coatings were optimized through careful synthesis and characterization.  This paper presents design, analysis, and optimization roadmap philosophy of a new cost-effective C-AICD that discriminates oil versus water with time/environment dependent selective dissolution of coatings on a ball. The process alters the diametrical position of the ball in the flow funnel/cylinder autonomously restricting flow port area available for inflow. Design and optimization methodology are presented with preliminary results of system mechanical and flow performance analysis. Further, the synthesis and characterization of the selective dissolvable layers is discussed.}

	abstract		= {Scope of the paper is to present a portfolio of promising design solutions currently available for the hydrogen value chain offshore and identify the most promising architectures for their deployment.  Hydrogen value chain is broken down by function and then by single process unit where applicable. Comparison of different design choices (i.  e centralised vs. decentralised) is provided based on the application of different Hydrogen production pathways and technologies and use of intermediate or final energy carrying methods (e.g. Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers, ammonia and ammonia carriers). A section is dedicated to pipeline transport offshore analyzing at high level the technology readiness also in terms of in-line subsea equipment. There are technologies or solutions at a lower readiness or in need of testing activity for confirming on a scientific basis the suitability for both Hydrogen and Offshore environment. The tests or initiatives required for gap areas are described.  In the analysis of the value chain, the ``direct offshore use'' for decarbonizing the shipping business is also analyzed considering the strong contribution of the sector in reaching the decarbonization target.  The analysis of the data collected through design cases application and market scouting offers a valid compass in the selection of the most suitable solution, even though, momentarily, some scenarios seem to be far from being achieved in the short term.  The paper gives a picture of how the energy transition focused on Hydrogen technologies and applied offshore is taking shape through a critical review of the data, the initiatives, the claims available along the supply chain from energy production to energy storage, transport and use. The overall conclusion is that the hydrogen value chain offshore is not only applicable but when based on lean, simple solutions, it promises to be very effective to concur to the net zero objective.}

	abstract		= {Carbon capture and storage is among a few technologies with the potential to enable significant CO2 emission reductions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as offshore production facilities. Within this context, many offshore operators are evaluating measures to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from their operations including those in Deepwater, and Energy contractors are re-shaping their technological expertise and potential solutions for meeting such challenging and increasing demand for lowering operations emissions.  The present paper will focus on a specific potential application, related to the offshore pipeline CO2 transportation from an offshore capture facility (deepwater or shallow water), to a permanent subsea storage location.  The work presented is the outcome of a joint effort by Exxon Mobil and Saipem articulated through phases:A framing exercise to shape different scenarios to be analyzed.  Engineering execution feasibility screening to characterize the above-mentioned scenarios, and to determine: What are the hurdles for deepwater CO2 capture, transportation via offshore pipeline and its sequestration?The challenges associated with CO2 transportation via an offshore pipeline, are spread among all the areas characterizing the system, e.g.:Flow Assurance: the flowing conditions of CO2 are strongly affected by the impurities content, and the bathymetry which the pipeline path traverses.  Material Selection: potential corrosion damage mechanisms must be carefully addressed vs. operating and transient flowing conditions.  Structural Integrity: the risk of failure associated with potential Running Ductile Fracture (RDF) must be considered and managed since early design phases.  Subsea Equipment: the equipment, not limited to the pipeline and riser, shall be assessed in terms of readiness and technological gaps, if any.  Safety: the potential risk of subsea CO2 dispersion shall be carefully evaluated.  Economics and Supportive Government Policy: Costs are generally key challenges associated with these potential emissions-reduction initiatives.  The study performed covered all the above areas through the involvement of Companies Engineering Departments, SME and Developers. All main building blocks of an offshore CO2 transport system have been analyzed during a high-level conceptual design activity to explore any potential criticality vs. their deployment in the specific application.  Location/asset-specific factors, supportive government policy, and continued technological advancements can be expected to remain important elements in operator analyses of the commercial viability of potential emissions reduction initiatives.  The findings from the presented activity provide offshore Operators considerations for the possibility of transporting CO2 between offshore CO2 capture location to sequestration reservoirs for permanent storage and provide the offshore industry with useful points of reflection.}

	abstract		= {Increasing activity within offshore wind energy and related installations has raised the focus on the integrity and fatigue life of power cables and umbilicals. A limiting factor for assessing fatigue life has been the lack of efficient and precise computational tools that are not overly conservative. This paper presents features of an advanced computational method implemented in a new tool for accurately assessing the integrity and predicting the fatigue service life of dynamic power cables and umbilicals.  Internal friction between components of power cables and umbilicals creates hysteretic stress responses that global finite element analysis ({FEA}) does not capture. It is widespread practice to assess irregular wave global responses through time-domain {FEA} and local cross-sectional analysis through specialized {FEA} tools. The global responses are combined with results from local {FEA} tools like UFLEX (developed by Sintef Ocean) to obtain accurate stresses capturing local effects, including friction induced hysteresis. Kongsberg Maritime introduced an innovative method in Hoen-Sorteberg et. al 2013 (OTC-24328-MS), employing tension-dependent hysteresis for flexible risers. This methodology has now been expanded to support power cables and Umbilicals.  Fatigue life assessment of unbonded structures like power cables and umbilicals involves analyzing various elements in the cross-section at multiple locations and orientations to accurately identify critical hotspots, considering load sharing and local friction between components like steel tubes, armor wires, and conductor strands exhibiting complex stress hysteresis behavior. Local {FEA} provides essential data to account for these complex hysteresis effects and linear stress factors like tension and component bending. The improved methodology and its implementation permit comprehensive stochastic fatigue assessment of power cables and umbilicals without imposing an undue computational burden. The outcome leads to more precise and often substantially prolonged fatigue life predictions by mitigating the inherent conservatism found in methods based on regular waves.  This paper demonstrates the practicality of the methodology and robustness through real-world implementation. The local-global approach yields precise stress levels comparable to direct local model analysis but with markedly enhanced computational efficiency. Previous similar methods suffered from limitations in both stress accuracy and computational speed, limiting their practical utility. A significant advantage is that this computational tool operates independently without needing specific {FEA} software integration, allowing users to utilize data from various sources.}

	abstract		= {As the global energy community moves towards the adoption of hydrogen and Natural Gas blends as a potential alternative to existing carbon-rich fuel, it is vital to develop the necessary infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen as a fuel and energy carrier of the future. Newer infrastructure is extremely cost-prohibitive and will significantly delay global decarbonization efforts. Transformation of existing infrastructure in handling hydrogen-based gas blends is the first step in achieving the targeted decarbonization goals.  Although existing natural gas pipelines may be suited for transporting hydrogen-natural gas blends, they are also vulnerable to leaks, embrittlement, and hydrogen-induced cracking, especially on newer high-strength steel (X70 or higher). This paper presents a new approach to preparing existing natural gas infrastructure for potential hydrogen-natural gas blends by protecting vulnerable steel surfaces with an advanced nanocomposite surface treatment. It remains, however, that understanding the impact of cyclic stress, fatigue, and the effect of hydrogen concentration on steel and surface-treated steel is vital to refining and advancing surface protection approaches.  To evaluate field operation conditions, a new experimental facility was set up, capable of conducting high pressure (up to 4000 psi) and high temperature (up to 572\textdegree{}F) testing following ASTM G142. High-pressure testing at 2000 psi in hydrogen blends indicates that the surface treatment has a strong barrier effect and demonstrated a reduction in the susceptibility to embrittlement under hydrogen. In addition, surface-treated coupons were installed in a commercial natural gas transmission pipeline that transports hydrogen (up to 15\%)-natural gas blends.  Decarbonization requires newer technologies that are designed to transform the current state-of-the-art energy infrastructure with minimal impact and at a rapid scale. The nanocomposite surface treatment presented here offers a highly scalable solution of in-place treatment of existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure to accelerate hydrogen-natural gas transportation and promote the use of low-carbon energy carriers for the energy industry and its end customers.}

	abstract		= {Design of mooring systems for floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) applications could greatly benefit from mooring system technology and knowledge that has evolved from the offshore oil and gas industry. Extensive studies in the offshore oil and gas industry have identified fatigue as one of the main causes of mooring failures. Based on this finding, there is certainly no reason to ignore this fatigue concern in FOWT industry. On the contrary, mooring systems in current FOWT industry are likely to be more vulnerable to fatigue due to following key reasons:Alongside the dynamic loading sources experienced by a typical oil and gas floating platform, a FOWT platform is also excited by additional major fatigue loadings attributed by the wind turbine operation.  The desire for cutting down capital costs is forcing developers to further reduce the number of mooring lines and the size of mooring components.  The light displacement FOWT platform moored in relatively shallow water with low to moderate pre-tension is exposed to slack in combination with snap loading of the mooring lines.  This paper demonstrates how an innovative mooring component solution, i.e., polymer spring, can mitigate the fatigue issues mentioned above and improve the fatigue life of the mooring system for FOWT application.  First, an overview of an ideal fatigue analysis procedure for FOWT is provided and why such a procedure is still not feasible or not economical based on the current computational capacity is explained. Then, a suitable fatigue analysis procedure is outlined utilizing the current state-of-the-art of analysis tools and hardware. This fatigue analysis procedure is based on first principal approach of the time-domain fully coupled dynamic analysis for a moored FOWT. It is tailored to enable the selection of the optimum parameters for the polymer spring with respect to reducing fatigue damages of the mooring lines. Using this fatigue analysis tool, the benefits of polymer spring mooring component in reducing the fatigue damages for FOWT mooring system are demonstrated. The following case studies are performed covering different floaters, turbine sizes, and mooring systems:Hywind Demo-2.3MW Spar with the as-installed mooring system.  VolturnUS-15MW Semi-submersible with taut polyester mooring system.  For each case study listed above, extensive fatigue analyses are performed for the base case mooring configuration, i.e., without the polymer spring, and the alternative configuration using the polymer spring components determined through the analysis procedure. The results in fatigue damages and fatigue life between each two configurations are then compared.  Cost benefit assessment of utilizing polymer spring as mooring components is performed by comparing it with other feasible base mooring configuration without polymer spring. This cost assessment includes capex, i.e., components cost of the mooring line, as well as cost related to transport and installation.  At the end of the paper, conclusions from the fatigue assessment results are drawn and some key benefits of polymer spring for FOWT mooring systems including the cost impact are highlighted.}

	abstract		= {Planning is essential to navigate the challenges and uncertainties posed by climate change as offshore marine energy development proceeds over the coming decades. This paper introduces the prototype version of the Canadian Coastal Zone Information System (CCZIS), a pioneering initiative developed jointly by ASL Environmental Sciences Inc. and Trailmark Systems Inc. through the Innovative Solutions Canada Challenge administered by Public Services and Procurement Canada (ISC, 2020). The core functionality of CCZIS lies in its ability to provide spatial-statistical representations of key metocean parameters such as water levels, waves, sea ice conditions, vertical allowances, and marine winds. One of CCZIS's ground-breaking features is its integration of regional model-based projections derived from coupled atmosphere-ocean models such as The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). CMIP5 is a collaborative international effort that involves a collection of climate models used to simulate and project the Earth's climate system (Taylor et al., 2012; IPCC, 2013). CMIP5 was coordinated by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and facilitated the comparison of climate models from different global institutions. It served as a framework for assessing the performance of these models, advancing our understanding of climate processes, and providing projections for future climate conditions. CMIP5 models simulate a range of climate variables, including temperature, precipitation, sea ice extent, and atmospheric circulation. These simulations help scientists and policymakers explore potential future climate scenarios under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.  CMIP-5 model realizations for different relative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP) contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, providing valuable data and insights that inform climate research, impact assessments, and policy decisions. Spanning a variety of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, from the conservative RCP 2.0 to the more extreme RCP 8.5, these projections enable users to toggle between different climate change scenarios with the number representing the increase in net surface radiative forcing. This functionality allows for comparative analysis against metocean design criteria used in past projects against different potential future climate change scenarios, thereby allowing for the assessment of expected metocean extremes under each RCP scenario. A variety of other data sources were reviewed such as the Canadian Extreme Water Level Adaptation Tool (CAN-EWLAT) (Greenan, 2022), MSC-50 (Swail et. al., 2007), etc., and are described further in the analysis section.  CCZIS displays three-dimensional bathymetric and infrastructure data together, through the combination of several data sources: high-resolution Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) Non-Navigational (NONNA) bathymetry (CHS, 2023) dredging survey data, seabed properties (borehole data), and its support for the geo-referenced three-dimensional display of present and future coastal and offshore infrastructure. In addition, CCZIS has a built-in user input-driven computational tool for computing nearshore waves, for large marine wind events, at any selected location. The integration of hydrographic data, seabed properties, and existing infrastructure with hindcast and future-looking metocean conditions offers a unified data fusion platform to ensure resilient engineering of offshore marine energy installations, including wind farms, energy platforms, transmission infrastructure, as well as ports and small craft harbors where support vessel operations will be based.}

	abstract		= {Intelligent well completions are complex design integrated packages that includes flow control tools, zonal isolation devices, downhole monitoring systems, control, and emergency shut-in systems. This complete package allows for local automation and optimization of multi-lateral reservoirs or target developments, as well as independent or remote-control operations. As part of the intelligent completion system, the downhole wet connect links the upper and lower completions providing hydraulic, electric or both linkage for power to lower completion equipment. This paper proposes a downhole electric Wetconnect concept that differs from current downhole methods in that it is conformal, nonmetallic, has a multishell-core structure, and self-healing capabilities that allow the structure to be restored once the electric contact is disengaged by removing connecting pin. This paper presents the construction, working principles and assessment of the unique electric connector and describes initial literature review from lab study on synthesis methods.  The procedure of developing the multishell-core connector is challenging and comprises selection, synthesis and interlacing of various layers with different properties. Metallic and Nonmetallic conductors, including powders, liquid metal, carbon materials, are anticipated to be employed as the connector’s core, which will be protected by dielectric layers. The material for the dielectric layers will be selected depending on temperature resistance and required thickness. The outer layers or shells can have cleaning and autonomous self-healing characteristics against both mechanical or electrical damage, by including microcapsules or employing the vascular network. Furthermore, self-healing elastomers are being studied for the outer most layer of downhole Wetconnector.  Non-Metallics for conducting core are carbon-nanotubes and graphene-based conductors, and like traditional metal wires, now have electrical characteristics of their metallic counterparts, as well as several benefits, such as resilience to severe temperatures. A highly stretchable and heat-resistant material will be chosen as the dielectric layer from a range of commercially available elastomers and other silicone compounds. Due to high cost of constructing a vascular network, microcapsules containing healing agents are preferred in terms of self-healing characteristics of the outer layer. It is possible to create a self-healing elastomer that combines the unique qualities of high stretchability and universally autonomous self-healing. The key to this design is the synergistic interaction of several dynamic bonds, such as disulfide metathesis, strong crosslinking H-bonds, and weak crosslinking H-bonds.  The paper introduces concepts and presents preliminary lab study of novel multishell-core flexible self-healing nonmetallic electric connector. The development plan includes electric connection evaluation, along with self-healing characteristics and resistance to water penetration under hydrostatic pressure. It is anticipated that when the tubing is redeployed, the intelligent well completion incorporated with this novel connector will allow for multiple orientation agnostic disconnect/reconnect of the upper completions and lower completions in a multi-lateral well configuration.}

	abstract		= {Optimized moorings are essential to floating wind feasibility. The identification of key factors for the choice of mooring connection method is vital for the successful installation of a commercial scale floating offshore wind farm.  Commercial scale floating wind farms will require quick connection with minimization of costs, risk, safety hazards and operational time offshore. Furthermore, any delays in the installation of floaters can cause a bottleneck in the industrialized production line as wet storage in the ports are finite. These challenges make choosing the right technology early in the development and planning stages crucial. If the wrong strategy is chosen, offshore installation can become the most expensive part of the project.  A simple disconnection method must also be available for the future should there be a need to tow the floating offshore wind platform with turbine back to port for major maintenance.  Presenting a case study from a successful mooring hook up and tensioning operation for a recent Floating Production Unit (FPU), we evaluate an optimized strategy for the installation of a typical wind farm. The case study demonstrates quick connection and re-tensioning capabilities. Additionally, the ability to quickly disconnect for towing back to shore is evaluated.  Methods to reduce vessel spread requirements, increase weather windows and de-risk offshore operations are demonstrated.  Key factors are identified to assist in early-stage decision making which affect aspects of the floater design and installation strategies.  Increasing weather windows for mooring installation is critical to operational success. When projects reach storm safe condition expeditiously, costs and risk associated with anchor handlers, tugs, crew, and equipment are minimized. The metocean conditions in many floating wind farm locations pose challenges in the form of wave height and current. The industry must improve operational limitations for these conditions.  Choosing a method that reduces time offshore for anchor handling vessels with high day rates reduces project cost and increases schedule flexibility. The hook up and tensioning methodology selected have a direct effect on vessel spread required, project risk, and cost to support mooring operations. For example, if a mooring strategy can allow the use of smaller, potentially more available lower cost vessels for hook up and tensioning, the larger Anchor Handling Vessels needed to handle large chain can be reserved for pre-laying the mooring lines only and not needed for hook up and tensioning. This aspect of planning is discussed later in this paper.  The addition of unnecessary ``person-hours exposed to risk'' or the damage/loss of a floater due to poor mooring strategy cannot be accepted. The costs and delay impact project viability. Additionally, the potential reputational damage to the entire industry adds immeasurable risk to the success of both commercial scale floating wind farms and global emissions reduction targets.  When a poor mooring strategy causes undue delays, requires expensive ships, or creates unnecessary risk, the cost of individual mooring components becomes insignificant. Considering the hook up and tensioning method holistically and logistically significantly reduces human and project risk.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents a multidisciplinary view of the evolution in the concept of a development project for the central area of Sururu and the method applied to address the challenges and propose solutions for the project in progress.  The central area of Sururu reservoir presents distinct characteristics from typical Brazilian Presalt fields, with low permeabilities despite of high porosity. This context brings challenges to define the best production development plan for the area, since its reservoir features, with low productivities, make conventional Presalt development architectures not suitable.  To support the production development strategy, an extensive but budget-oriented appraisal plan was carried out, including an early production system connecting one well to an existing Floating Production Storage and Offloading ({FPSO}). This data acquisition effort was extremely important to enable an evaluation of the long-term productivity as well as a better understanding and dynamic characterization of the reservoir.  As a natural outcome of this comprehensive appraisal plan, the project base case has undergone drastic conceptual changes during its evolution, from a first concept including a stand-alone Floating Production Unit (FPU) to drain the area, to the current production strategy, comprising a reduced number of wells to be connected through a long tie-back to an infrastructure already installed in the area.  The current development solution comprises a manifold with four production wells connected to it and a subsea Multiphase Pump (MPP) to lift the fluids. To improve reservoir management in this shared production configuration and allow production allocation, one Multiphase Flow Meter (MPFM) for each production well will be included in the manifold. The drainage system also contains a water injection well to support the reservoir pressure, in a reversed five-spot configuration.  Gathering the wells, flowrates at a manifolded system are higher than conventional satellite configuration and contribute to reduce some flow assurance risks. Moreover, a Hydrate Mitigation Cross-Over (HMXO) equipment allowing the connection between service and production lines at the riser base will be installed to reduce hydrate issues.  The low productivity and the decreasing reservoir pressure mean that artificial lift is mandatory. Subsea multiphase boosting will bring an increment in production due to the favorable conditions for this type of technology and to the limitation of gas processing in the existing {FPSO}, which will reduce the gas available for gas lift.  The appraisal, project optimization and non-conventional technologies for the Brazilian Presalt environment have allowed Petrobras and its partners to point out a promising production development solution which reduces risks and improves economic results in a highly challenging reservoir environment.}

Due to the lack of available literature, standard practices or industry guidelines on this topic, the authors performed in-house research on the subject. This paper deals with full scale testing performed to investigate the load-penetration behavior of armor rock. Tests comprised penetration of a steel pile section of a monopile into armor rock of two different gradings, placed on a sand bed in a 20 ft container. A DEM model with an equivalent setup was built and calibrated against the experimental test results and subsequently used to model a full size monopile case. Insight into the variability of penetration resistance was acquired by conducting multiple tests during the experimental and numerical modelling phases. Next to estimating self-weight penetration, knowing the penetration resistance over depth relation for a given scour protection layer provides an understanding of the penetration behavior of the pile at the transition zone between scour protection and seabed (i.e. potential for punch-through) and answers the question about necessity to use a piling hammer to penetrate the scour protection.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this work is to study the effect of variability in the well flowrate and well target location on layout design of subsea production system. This work introduces an uncertainty quantification approach to assess the variability in subsea production system layout design, utilizing a subsea layout simulation frame-work which incorporates several design considerations such as well target locations in the reservoir, wells per manifold, bathymetry of the seabed, exclusion areas on the seabed, flow assurance, metocean considerations, flowline laying considerations, and pigging of flowlines. This simulation framework encompasses a collection of subsystem-level models, namely drill center clustering, manifold positioning, process host positioning, and flowline design. Algorithmic methodologies adeptly address each individual subproblem. The uncertainty quantification approach incorporates both random and deterministic variables of the field layout design. Random variables stem from the stochastic nature of reservoirs. Latin hypercube sampling serves as the foundation for generating required input samples. Modeling of the well flow rates involves treating them as correlated random variables, leveraging reservoir-specific characteristics. Furthermore, modeling of the well target locations employs uncorrelated random variables.  The proposed approach’s effectiveness undergoes rigorous scrutiny via two real-world use cases aimed at studying field layout design variations, including manifold numbers, flowline length, and total cost index. Generated correlated flow rates for wells adhere to a given probability density function, where correlation coefficients consistently exceed 0.9, aligned with reservoir-specific characteristics. Moreover, the proposed simulation model framework achieves the generation of feasible designs that fulfill specified design requirements. Within uncertainty analysis, deterministic inputs of the subsea layout simulation model remain constant, and the number of solutions is varied based on the number of production wells. Use case 1 and 2 involve 19 and 37 production wells, respectively. For each design sample, use case 1 and 2 produce 68 and 132 design alternatives, respectively, and generated results are ranked based on the total cost index to select the top performing design. Finally, each use case presents a statistical summary detailing the flowline length and total cost index. The results show that the proposed uncertainty quantification approach can quantify the variation in the field layout design of subsea production system. The proposed simulation model framework gives different feasible design options by changing the solution parameters.  The novelty of the proposed approach is its ability to incorporate stochastic nature of reservoir and geological condition into initial design stages. The current approach takes both the deterministic and random variables into account while designing the field layout. Also, the simulation model framework presented is novel, and it produces different feasible design options by changing the solution parameter while considering all the specified design requirements. This approach is incredibly useful for the field layout design engineer to consider different feasible design alternatives.}

	abstract		= {The scope of this work is to present the main results obtained with the interfaces standardization on Wet Christmas Trees (WCTs) and its Electrohydraulic Multiplex (EHMUX) Subsea Control Systems in pre-salt scenario, in Brazil, which completes more than 10 years since their first installation. This work also presents how much the standardization of interfaces reduced the OEM (Original Equipment Supplier) dependance, how it helped to mitigate field operational issues, and how new opportunities of broader applications are being pursued in recent projects.  The WCT-interfaces standardization has been developing in Brazil since the beginning of the 90's, where Pre-Salt WCTs is the last generation. A review of the cases where this standardization succeeded was made, allowing the demonstration of its value to mitigate suppliers’ delays, to minimize cost in projects’ implementation, to increase flexibility and to overcome o perational issues faced in the field.  Several examples of successful cases were found where standardization helped to mitigate issues in delivery schedule, changes in projects schedule and scope, and equipment failures faced in the field. Statistics have been carried out on this data showing estimated gains obtained. Additionally, for global service-only contracts with tools owned by the operator, to project-oriented services and tools availability contracts, the interchangeability level provided by the standardization became much more relevant, since it opens more alternatives for services’ contracting, from the OEM or other suppliers. Some challenges to become completely independent of OEM were identified and will be presented in this paper, as well as different scenarios where the standardization application is wider or narrower. Some opportunities were identified in recent projects, fostering new equipment suppliers, softening the transition to next equipment generation from the same supplier and enable the use of all-electrical shared actuation systems in subsea manifolds connected to WCTs from a different supplier.  Besides, this paper discusses on the main achievements obtained with the philosophy of standardization of the EHMUX-type Subsea Control System (SCS) for WCTs and subsea manifolds, also standardized for applications of the Brazilian pre-salt, which in 2023 completed 10 years since the first installation of the combination of standardized SCS and WCT, in the Sapinhoa field. The use of this standardized SCS allowed full operational interchangeability between SCS equipment and both the Brazilian pre-salt standards of WCTs and subsea manifolds, supplied by the main vendors of subsea equipment. The standardization of the SCS has also been helping to deal with operational problems that arise during the productive life of fields, minimizing the number of failures and their related costs.}

	abstract		= {DNV and 38 project partners have been working together in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to identify, understand and tackle the challenges involved in taking the step from bottom-fixed to floating substations. A floating substation will be critical for many projects, to bring clean energy from floating offshore wind farms to the market and consumers. A floating substation is also a meeting point between different disciplines and stakeholders. The JIP involves a broad selection of the value chain representing this meeting point. The group includes both HV component and dynamic cable vendors, engineering companies, designers and yards and not the least companies that will operate and own; Developers and Transmission System Operators.  The objectives of the Floating Substations Joint Industry Project are to: (i) Identify technology gaps and the development and qualification efforts required close these gaps (ii) Identify gaps in standards and (iii) Establish joint understanding and alignment of best industry practice and technical requirements for design, construction, and operation of offshore floating substations. To meet these objectives, the project has defined a design basis, performed gap analyses, technology assessments and failure mode analyses for the key parts of floating substations. Both HVAC and HVDC systems have been addressed. Floater motion analyses and dynamic cable feasibility analyses have been performed and compared for suitability for carrying the HV equipment. Key questions to be answered include (i) what is the right safety level for design of a substation (or: what failure probability per year is acceptable) (ii) what are the motion characteristics of a substation and how does this compare to what the topside HV equipment can tolerate (iii) how can we qualify feasible export system designs. The project has undertaken defined activities to find answers to these questions.  The ultimate goal of the project has been to develop sufficient knowledge and cross-industry understanding to make floating substations a reality with an acceptable level of commercial, technical and HSE risk. The knowledge developed through the JIP will form basis for design standards for floating substations and dynamic cables. In this presentation, DNV will give an overview of the project results, the plans ahead for standard integration and required next steps.}

	abstract		= {The execution of six different jetting operations in Santos pre-salt basin serves as field proof for methodology in conductor casing design and brings up new problems that need to be addressed for complete success both in the jetting operation and in the construction of the second section of the well.  Several jetting operations were executed in three different pre-salt fields of the Santos Basin, using the most recent guidelines in Petrobras conductor casing design. As the six wells had very similar drilling scope \textendash{} they all had jetted conductor casing and surface casing cemented up to mudline\textendash{} which made possible to sort out similar patterns and difficulties in jetting performance, cement operations and housing installation.  The observations indicated good overall performance during the jetting operation, but all jetting operations needed BHA weight slack off in addition to casing weight, also known as compression jetting. Another running tool resource that could be used in high difficulty jetting operations is called pre-drilling, which means disconnecting the jetting tool mandrel, drilling ahead to weaken the soil and reconnecting to resume jetting, in order to achieve the final depth, was planned as possibility in every well design, but was not deemed necessary during the execution. Surface casing section, with extensions up to 1300 m, had good overall performance in drilling. Open hole caliper was estimated using tracer pills and pressure monitoring while pumping high density fluid prior to pulling the drill string out of the hole. Surface casings cement jobs were all successful in filling the whole annular with cement up to the wellhead, a critical point to future well integrity. In some wells, when disconnecting the cement job running tool, a difficulty in identifying the neutral point in the wellhead caused an excess slack off and, consequently, a downward movement in conductor casing was observed, needing to pick up weight again and wait on cement for final disconnection.  Jetting operations identified the need for development of running tools that are able to apply additional weight without risk of disconnection during the jetting; to be able to disconnect, drill ahead, reconnect and resume the jetting; to be able to visually identify the neutral point in the wellhead; and, finally, to be able to lock the High Pressure Housing into position without additional slack off besides the surface casing weight.  Successful jetting operations in Santos Basin opened possibilities for further performance enhancement in well drilling, that will only be totally fulfilled with respective technology development. This work points out some of the development opportunities in jetting running tools and in wellhead systems that could bring more reliability to jetting operations and guarantee both performance and well foundation integrity.}

	abstract		= {Pseudo Dry Gas (PDG) technology is proposed as an alternative concept for transporting multiphase fluids (gas, condensate, and water) for long deep-water subsea tieback developments while delivering significant reductions in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by the mitigation of compression (Liebana, et al, 2021)). The basis of the PDG system is to remove the liquid from the main pipeline using piggable liquid removal unit(s). With the removal of the majority of liquid, the shape of the internal resistance curve of the tieback is changed from a quadratic function to a linear function over the operational envelope, allowing the pipeline to operate like a ``pseudo" dry gas system. The original prototype of this design underwent low pressure flow loop testing (Thomas, et al 2021)).  The current work involved the fabrication of a 180 bar rated PDG unit, a subsea magnetic drive pump and the supporting subsea control system for flow loop testing undertaken at T\"{U}V S\''{U}D National Engineering Laboratories (hereinafter NEL), UK. This development program is supported by operators in conjunction with the Net Zero Technology Center. The testing program is developed to encompass the expected operational envelope that the PDG units would see in service aligned to a broad range of asset-based study work and to consider critical non-dimensional flow assurance parameters to ensure scalability. The testing parameters considered are pressure (up to 125 bar), temperature (up to 40 C), and inclination (zero- and two-degrees). In addition, various liquids are considered e.g., two hydrocarbon fluids (representing oil and condensate), brine water, and hydrocarbon and brine water mixture.  An extensive number of test points at different liquid and gas superficial velocities are included both with and without the PDG unit installed to allow for baseline comparisons, with entrainment samples being collected upstream and downstream of PDG unit aligned to the Tulsa University technique (Bhaskoro, et al 2024). This paper will focus on how varying certain parameters including superficial gas velocity, superficial liquid velocity, and pressure impacts the separation efficiency and liquid entrainment. Some examples of mapping actual study results onto the high-pressure testing results are included to allow a greater understanding of required versus actual performance.  Results show comparable PDG separation performance at high pressure for all cases indicating negligible impact of higher pressures in relation to required performance as linked to the actual study cases.}

	abstract		= {In the beginning of 2021, Petrobras created its future vision for floating production storage and offloading ({FPSO}) projects and decided to create a value creation program based in the following aspects: build an interdepartmental effort (Engineering, Research \& Development [R\&D], and Operation), with a strategic approach through key topics, channeling resources to add value to our projects. Besides, the idea was to concentrate the innovation pipeline in a single governance, creating a discussion forum apart from projects schedule (conceptual and front-end engineering design [FEED] development). The challenges related to future projects were mapped and objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined: increase net present value (NPV) of {FPSO} projects and reduce human exposure to risk and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The program, currently called {FPSO}+, is based on a portfolio of optimization and innovation projects (incremental and disruptive) to evaluate improvements in the designs (concept and FEED phases) where key problems are mapped, and solutions are searched inside the project teams, R\&D initiatives, supply chain and through industry benchmark. Challenges and the required solutions are evaluated considering an integrated future vision for {FPSO}s, where Engineering, R\&D and Operation work together to optimize total lifecycle cost of ownership (TLCO), reduce emissions and reduce human risk exposure.  It was achieved a reduction around 16\% in GHG emissions (kgCO2 e/boe, per new {FPSO}), 30\% increase in NPV and approximately 4\% reduction in man-hours exposed to risk (engineering, procurement, and construction [EPC] phase and offshore phase). These results are related to 2021 and 2022. The portfolio includes a variety of areas, from digital solutions to new processing concepts and from new coatings and non-metallic materials to design simplification. Management procedures were created for portfolio planning and execution, including a valuation guideline, new technologies risk assessment and KPIs for the teams involved. The valuation components (capital expenditure [CAPEX], operational expenditure [OPEX], GHG emissions, oil and gas production impacts) required a strategy to be obtained from solid technical data and reliable sources.}

	abstract		= {The use of distributed buoyancy modules as a lateral buckle mitigation device in High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) flowlines requires consideration of a range of parameters to ensure a successful solution. An investigation into several of these parameters and their impacts on lateral buckling behavior is explored.  Buoyancy module spacing, the submerged weight in buoyancy sections, the buoyancy section configuration and length, and soil-pipe interactions at end modules are explored via the finite-element method. Sensitivities on these parameters for a single pipe diameter are explored as they relate to the lateral buckling behavior and associated industry-imposed limit states.  A rigid 8-inch HPHT production flowline is investigated for each of the parameters described. Finite-element models are used to investigate the lateral buckling behavior in virtual-anchor-spacing (VAS) models.  The VAS modeling of various distributed-buoyancy system parameters provides results that confirm the importance of adequately assessing these parameters in the design process.  VAS modeling demonstrates that buoyancy-module spacing, and buoyancy-section submerged weight, configuration, and length can all materially impact lateral buckling behavior and flowline integrity. It is found that each of these parameters needs to stay within a certain range for satisfactory performance, based on industry guideline VAS acceptance criteria and model stability, and going outside that range can yield unreliable and potentially risky lateral buckling behavior.  Ranges for the various parameters used in the design of distributed buoyancy sections are offered that will help ensure a robust and reliable distributed buoyancy solution.}

	abstract		= {This paper delineates a groundbreaking intervention in South Kuwait Field, where the integrity of a well for workover rig operations was successfully reinstated by harnessing instrumented coiled tubing (CT) combined with a through-tubing inflatable and retrievable packer (TTIRP).  In the described scenario, mechanical obstructions at the Christmas tree tubing hanger posed significant challenges for the conventional installation of the blowout preventer (BOP) on the workover rig. This necessitated the adoption of a tailored approach to establish the essential pressure barriers for well intervention.  The implemented intervention strategy utilized instrumented CT for the dual purposes of well killing and temporary suspension. The real-time downhole telemetry of the CT played a crucial role in guaranteeing the precise deployment and activation of the TTIRP within the production tubing. Following a comprehensive pressure test of the packer from both ends, the CT was removed. Subsequently, a sand plug and an acid-soluble cement plug were strategically positioned above the TTIRP. After verifying the integrity of the cement plug, the workover rig was engaged to fit the BOP. The instrumented CT was then redeployed into the well to dissolve the cement plug, remove the sand, and extricate the TTIRP back to the surface.  The targeted well for this advanced intervention workflow was characterized by a maximum potential wellhead pressure of about 1,500 psi and a plug-back true depth (PBTD) of 4,000 ft. The well's completion involved 3 1/2-in. production tubing installed up to approximately 3,500 ft measured depth (MD) and 8 5/8-in. casing extending to the PBTD. Prior to the initial CT operation, an e-line through-tubing puncher was utilized in the production tubing to facilitate the circulation of the killing fluid. The TTIRP's setting depth was meticulously prepared using the instrumented CT and a high-pressure rotary jetting tool, achieving a shut-in wellhead pressure close to zero psi.  The outcomes of this cutting-edge intervention workflow were remarkable, conserving an estimated 195,000 barrels of deferred production as the well had been shut-in for a minimum duration of ten months. The insights and experiences accrued from this case study are poised to act as valuable guidelines for operators in the Middle East faced with comparable well challenges.}

(LPS) endeavors to conceive, construct, and assess a comprehensive marine and riverine hydrokinetic current energy conversion apparatus within the Kootznahoo Inlet (Angoon, Alask a) under the aegis of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) \textendash{} Submarine Hydrokinetic and Riverine Kilo-megawatt Systems (SHARKS) project. Systematic surveys of tidal flow velocities, bathymetry, and water levels within the inlet were conducted to discern spatial and temporal flow variations, pinpointing the optimal deployment location for the device. Quasi-synoptic measurements of current speed and direction were captured along cross-inlet transects at the projected location of maximum flow velocity employing an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADCP). In tandem with these measurements, sophisticated one-dimensional (1D) DYNLET and Delft{3D} hydrodynamic circulation models were developed for the inlet. The numerical models were pivotal in extrapolating from flow measurements, thereby providing a thorough characterization and validation of spatial and temporal variations. Calibration and validation of the models were achieved using measured transect velocity data, subsequently employed to predict velocity estimates across the inlet throughout the tidal cycle. Comparative analyses revealed the consistent identification of the most robust flows during peak flood and ebb tide, proximate to the southeast side of the inlet (adjacent to the Village Rock) in relatively shallow water depths. The determination of tidal energy resources often entails a time-intensive and costly endeavor. Conventionally, two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional ({3D}) circulation models are developed to furnish time series velocity data, facilitating an assessment of the tidal energy resource at a given site. This paper presents a case study of tidal energy resource assessment and development at Kootznahoo Inlet, incorporating an economical 1D circulation model (DYNLET) in conjunction with a 2D version (Delft{3D}). The paper delineates the advantages and limitations of the 1D model, juxtaposed with the benefits and limitations inherent in the 2D approach.}

The vessel used for this project was R/V Seward Johnson, a Research/Survey vessel. The Piston Corer used for the survey, to work in depths above 3000 meters, was configured with a core head weighing 1,500 kg, with a maximum length of the sampling tube of 12 m and a 3.5 meters free fall. The samples were recovered in a 102 mm inner diameter plastic PVC (liner) coating within the 112 mm outer diameter steel tube. In addition to being stationary, the Piston Corer have a piston immobilizer, that protects the sample from disruptive forces during pull-out. The gravity CPT that was used in this campaign was coupled on Piston Corer structure, to function in the pressure of deep water. For this Project, gCPT tests was conducted to verify the soil resistance and Piston Corer samples collected, to analyze tactile-visual Classification, determination of moisture content, determination of apparent specific weight, evaluation of the content of Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and determination of Undrained Shear Strength (Su) by pocket penetometer test, torvane test and laboratory mini vane test. Through the piston core sampling and tactile visual classification, it was possible to define the soil content in the area, consisted of normally consolidated clays. This geotechnical survey has few locations to make a more accurate assessment of what may have occurred geologically in this area. Despite few evidence, analyzing the Piston Core samples onshore, along with gCPT results, the layers of deposition of the sediment were identified, with the general soil composition of the area being described as light brown clayed SILT with fine sand and shell fragments in the superficial sediments and dark gray silty CLAY with fine sand in the deeper sediments. The data produced from this campaign shows the possibility of geotechnical studies in areas of deep water, over 3500 meters depth, with reliable results. In order to work in a deep area, there were some alterations needed in the equipment, such as assembling the CPT in Piston Corer structure, and using a Piston immobilizer on the piston corer sampler. The improved equipment provided good quality data of the region.}

	abstract		= {Current measurements from a subsurface mooring offshore Guyana have been conducted by ExxonMobil in support for the oil and gas development in the area from March 2016 to March 2017. Understanding the current structure and inertial and sub-inertial period variations associated with the North Brazil Current (NBC) rings in the area are important to the development of the design and operational criteria off Guyana given the increase in activities by the oil and gas industry in the study region. The mooring was deployed near 57\textdegree{}W, 8\textdegree{}N in the water depth of 1678 m. Four NBC rings, which were measured during the one-year measurement campaign, can be categorized into three types based on their temporal and spatial (vertical) structures. The first two rings measured in the boreal spring of 2016 are shallow, fast-moving rings with the maximum penetration depth around 200m. The third ring is a slow-moving, deep feature with the penetration depth up to 1000 m. The fourth one is a fast-moving, deep ring with the penetration depth up to 800 m. A reversal current is observed flowing southwesterly along the coastline beneath all of the rings for the most part of the measurement period. Noteworthy inertial period variations are measured in the upper 200 m only with the arrival of the NBC rings and persistently in summer. Enhancement of the sub-inertial (5-10 days) variations is also detected in association with all four rings, suggesting that sub-inertial oscillations can be excited by the NBC rings.}

	abstract		= {This study explores the feasibility of CO2 transportation and injection for Korea's 1st large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in a depleted gas reservoir in the East Sea, South Korea. In this study, the necessity of heating CO2 at the offshore platform is examined. Operating envelope of the CO2 injector in light of near-wellbore Joule-Thompson (JT) cooling and hydrate formation is also investigated. The study informs the basis of facility design to attain the CO2 injection target.  Transient thermo-hydraulic simulations using OLGA were conducted to establish the safe operating envelope and optimal injection strategy. The study considered re-using the existing flowlines, offshore platforms, and wells. Two development strategies were considered, with or without heating CO2 at the offshore platform. Two reservoir pressures were considered: early life and late life. Hydrate formation risk in flowlines, well and near-wellbore areas were assessed.  This study assesses various methods to mitigate hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells within CCS projects. Each tested concept has distinct advantages and drawbacks, emphasizing the need for optimizing transport and injection systems to minimize energy consumption during steady injection.  The primary discovery indicates that implementing an early injection strategy is crucial for preventing hydrate formation in CO2 injection wells. The study reveals that heating CO2 during the initial injection phase proves ineffective in averting near-wellbore hydrate formation, mainly due to substantial heat dissipation in the subsea flowline. Furthermore, even with heating, fluid temperatures near the sandface drop below freezing, creating favorable conditions for hydrate formation. This approach enhances the economic viability of CCS projects by eliminating the need for costly mitigation methods, rendering them more financially appealing.  This study addresses CO2 injection challenges in highly depleted reservoirs for geologic sequestration. Our systematic approach optimizes transport and injection systems, thereby improving CCS project economics and making depleted fields more attractive for CO2 storage. Our results provide valuable insights into the feasibility of large-scale CCS in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, offering cost-effective hydrate mitigation methods, supporting viable CCS solutions, and contributing to global greenhouse gas reduction efforts.}

	abstract		= {As decommissioning operations continue to expand, the challenges associated with evaluating the integrity of the cement layer and its bond to casing and formation become more pronounced. Ensuring hydraulic isolation of the wellbore from the surrounding environment is crucial before permanently sealing the well. However, the current methodology relies on the expertise of specialists who interpret extensive and intricate data obtained through logging operations. Recognizing the challenges inherent in cement evaluation, Ouronova, in collaboration with Repsol Sinopec Brazil, is developing a computational solution to help specialists interpret cement integrity logging data. Simultaneously, the developed tool aims to assist operators in optimizing the planning and management of decommissioning campaigns. The innovative software employs machine learning techniques that have exhibited significant promise in enhancing accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in the analysis of cement sheath integrity. Thus, the objective of this paper is to present some results obtained with the software by using Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the cement condition in two wellbore regions. The acquired dataset was used to generate Variable Density Logs diagram and plots here referred to as 2D Combined Signals, which were used as inputs to train the model. The main results indicate good accuracy in predicting the cement condition using the Variable Density Log and the 2D Combined Signals. In special, the latter showed to be a more promising option because its accuracy value tended to be more stable as the database was increased, in comparison with the Variable Density Log case. As a metric for the comparisons, the Balanced Adjacency Accuracy was used. For the results based on the Variable Density Log, we found a value of 0.810, while for the ones based on the 2D Combined Signals, we found 0.958.}

	abstract		= {The paper aims at presenting the extensive qualification approach adopted for the Hybrid Composite Flexible Pipe (HFP). The test results presented are mainly focused on the capacity of the PEEK-Carbon Fiber composite material and the pipe to resist to harsh environment, which combines high CO2 content, high pressure, and temperature, demonstrating that HFP is a Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) resistant solution in ultra-deep-water environments.  The extensive testing campaign leveraged the classical pyramid approach described in DNV standard RP-A203, starting with material small scale to conclude on product full scale tests. The models developed aims at bridging the gaps from the idealized material level to full scale level. A comprehensive description of the testing done at the different scales to qualify the product for the most aggressive environments is given, including innovative methodology for end-of-life characterization for both material and the full-scale levels. Results of correlation between the experimental full scale prototypes tests and models are also provided.  At material scale level, a first step called fluid screening was conducted, aiming at identifying the most detrimental fluid to be conservatively used for all the subsequent small-scale testing campaign. The most significant finding is that the PEEK-CF composite material is inert to high contents of H2S. Additionally, there is no ageing of the material exposed to fluids with large CO2-content, demonstrating a good resistance and stability in CO2-rich environments. Results of the long-term properties measurement (fatigue and stress-rupture mainly) under continuous presence of high CO2-content fluid combined with high pressure and temperature, are also discussed. The permeation testing campaign revealed excellent permeation properties leading to a dramatic drop of CO2 partial pressure in the tensile armor wires annulus compared to conventional flexible pipe, making HFP a definitive SCC-free solution. Additionally, results of HFP full-scale tests done after months of CO2 saturation at high pressure and temperature have demonstrated a very good stability and behavior of the product over time. Finally, the paper presents the calculation model developed and compares it against the tests done at the medium scale and HFP full-scale levels, showing a very good correlation.  The Hybrid Composite Flexible Pipe is a breakthrough technology combining the best composite material and the conventional flexible pipes. The novelty of HFP lies in the ability to solve sustainably the SCC challenge, observed on conventional flexible pipes, for a service life of 30 years, allowing the safe use of this step-change flexible pipe technology in harsh and CO2-rich environments.}

	abstract		= {Developing offshore wind farms requires effective mapping of shallow subsurface for turbine foundation design, construction, and monitoring, all of which face many challenges in especially field data conditioning, structure interpretation and modeling, and geotechnical property estimation. In this paper, we revisit these challenges from the perspective of pattern recognition and propose implementing deep learning (DL) into automating three essential tasks in windfarm site characterization, including (i) cone-penetration testing (CPT) data conditioning, (ii) ultra-high resolution (UHR) seismic horizon picking, and (iii) integrated geotechnical property estimation, which leads to an accelerated workflow for delivering reliable ground models in an offshore windfarm site of interest. Specifically, the CPT data conditioning aims at identifying outliers in CPT data and reconstructing missing segments via a 1D auto-encoder. The UHR seismic horizon picking aims at tracking key horizons in collected UHR seismic via a two-step supervised DL and building a horizon model that captures the primary structural patterns in the target area. The integrated geotechnical property estimation aims at integrating the reconstructed CPT logs, the UHR seismic images, and the horizon models into simultaneously estimating multiple geotechnical properties such as cone-tip resistance (RES) and friction ratio (FRR) via semi-supervised DL. As tested over the public Borssele dataset within the Dutch Offshore Windfarm Zone, the proposed DL-accelerated workflow successfully improves the quality of CPT data, picks multiple major horizons that reflect the complexities of shallow subsurface, and constructs the corresponding RES and FRR models that delineate the lateral variations in geotechnical across the Borssele area.}

The results of the paper highlight the remarkable achievements of the "Enhancing Well Efficiency '' Program in the development of the Buzios oil field. The program successfully incorporated cutting-edge technologies, resulting in a substantial reduction of well construction costs, in line with the ambitious 30\% target. Equipment reliability improved significantly, leading to more efficient reservoir management, and positioning Petrobras as a leader in offshore well construction. The observations reveal that the early integration of technology selection, thorough planning, and collaboration with research centers enabled Petrobras to address challenges and expedite the implementation of innovative solutions. The results illuminate the importance of efficient processes in the adoption of technology, providing valuable insights for organizations seeking to expedite their technological integration efforts. The conclusions drawn from this study underscore the importance of proactive planning and technology integration in complex deepwater projects. The Enhancing Well Efficiency program model, with its focus on cost reduction and enhanced reliability, has set a benchmark for the industry, demonstrating the feasibility of early-stage technology adoption, even in challenging environments.

	abstract		= {This paper proposes an offshore Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) to interface with subsea oil and gas production systems and offshore renewable energy sources (like wind, floating solar, etc.). Such a HESS will provide a stable energy supply for an extended period, reducing the need for carbon-heavy backup systems such as diesel generators, thereby resulting in a much cleaner energy future. The proposed offshore architecture is modeled using a Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) along with offshore renewables (primarily wind energy), subsea loads (such as drives for pumps, compressors, etc.), and a medium voltage DC (MVDC) grid. Each unit of the HESS is constructed using an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen from electricity, a hydrogen tank to store the fuel, and a fuel cell to transform hydrogen back into electrical energy. Each unit has separate converters to step up/down the voltage. These units are further interconnected through a multi-level cascaded bridge architecture to achieve a 6 kV output. The multi-level cascaded bridge architecture ensures the reliable operation of the system by re-balancing the energy storage electrically between the cascaded mode and protecting the system from any misshape that happens in the system. Suppose a fault occurs in one of the fuel cell units. In that case, the cascaded bridge architecture disconnects that unit from the system. It compensates for that unit by recovering the difference voltage from the other units to maintain the 6 kV DC output voltage.}

The state-of-the-art ocean observing technologies provide near-real-time surface and subsurface co-located temperature, salinity and velocity observations and were assessed for improvements to the predictive capability of multiple federal and industry operational ocean circulation models. Six ocean buoyancy gliders were deployed in the western Yucatan Strait near Mahahual, M\'{e}xico - four of the gliders were deployed in January 2024, two gliders were deployed from July thru November 2023. The summer and fall 2023 glider data was assimilated into the NOAA RTOFS numerical model and significantly improved the model performance to accurately represent the vertical hydrographic structure of the inflowing water from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf of M\'{e}xico via the Yucatan Strait. The high-frequency radar system deployed near Cancun, M\'{e}xico was operational throughout the experiment. Radar observations of surface velocity during fall 2023 observed the passage of extreme weather events, including Hurricane Idalia (26 August \textendash{} 2 September). Additionally, the hi-frequency radar observed the spatial and temporal position of the Yucatan Current speed core as the Loop Current System in the Gulf of M\'{e}xico evolved from a retracted state to an extended state, to a detached state, with numerous reattachment sequences. The research underscores the complexity of the four-dimensional structure of the Loop Current system and the spatial and temporal evolution of the circulation in response to topographic, tidal, geostrophic, ageostrophic, and wind forcing. Additional observations from airborne and subsurface observational platforms reveal sub-mesoscale variability and the correlation between surface and subsurface current patterns.}

	abstract		= {Today’s society continues to be heavily dependent on hydrocarbons for its energy needs. At the same time, we are seeing high sensitivity in the oil prices due to global events like COVID pandemic or changing geopolitical landscapes. To manage these fluctuations E\&P companies are trying to become more efficient in the way they run their operations. This has challenged service companies to come with innovative solutions to help operators increase their hydrocarbon production with existing resources. This paper describes one such solution.  With decades of remote operations experience we now have an Integrated Operations execution model where advanced remote operations combined with latest technologies in digitization and automation can provide integrated solutions more safely, efficiently and sustainably. This model has 3 major components: Multi-skilled Field Professionals (FPRO) at rig site.  Remote Professionals at Integrated remote operations center.  Digital Technology enablers - Automation software, Rig communication technology, remote access, and visualization tools.  FPRO are multiskilled personnel performing surface equipment handling and physical tasks on the rigsite. The number of multiskilled personnel can vary between three for offshore and two for land operations. Further optimization is achieved by having FPRO floating between rigs wherever possible. The multiskilling framework is embedded in training and competency structure where competencies are assigned, trained, and monitored to get them completed. Once complete they can perform different tasks at the rigsite. Roles and responsibilities of FPRO, Remote Professionals and other personal are clearly defined. FPRO are supported by Drilling contractor personal and remote professionals operating from remote center. Remote Professionals are highly trained and competent SME’s which are based in remote center and work along with rigsite FPRO to ensure flawless and consistent service delivery. The remote professionals are competent and qualified to deploy different tools and services. They are supported by technical support team based out of remote center. Successful transition of up to 50\% tasks from rig site to a remote operation center is possible. POB reduction up to 67\% was achieved in one case.  Technology enablers are key to achieve the perfect synchronization and efficiency between the FPRO and Remote Professionals. Statement of requirement (SOR) for connectivity and rig infrastructure for communication are defined. Automation software’s in Drilling Services, Automated Pressure Pumping unit and Automated Fluid Monitoring system act as enablers. Digital visualization tools and optimization software are further enablers. The Integrated Operations model as a service offering aims to drive standardization through alignment with customer requirements, HSE drivers, global operational procedures, competency development, Service delivery and financial KPIs. This is a steppingstone in the process to change the way operators and service companies operate at rigsite.}

	abstract		= {The maritime industry is exploring pathways to mitigate its environmental footprint using negative emissions technologies (NETs) such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) by 2050 to achieve significantly lower gas emissions from shipping and offshore facilities. This paper investigates the safety and integrity challenges associated with onboard CCS (OCCS) deployed on marine vessels and offshore installations. First, the study reviews different CO2 capture techniques and onboard storage and then, elucidates CO2's physical states and properties, as they relate to these processes. Using a comprehensive analysis of literature and previous incidents related to carbon capture and storage systems, this study highlights potential hazards associated with these processes to help in understanding the associated risks and limitations. Finally, it investigates case studies that illustrate how these identified hazards can manifest as tangible safety challenges within the framework of OCCS. CO2 chemical properties can be categorized into three major groups: those related to capture, storage \& transportation, and safety hazards. Capturing CO2 from the ship's exhaust gas can be done through one of several mechanisms: liquid absorption, solid adsorption, membrane, cryogenic separation, and calcium looping. Regardless of the capture technique, the current state of the art is that CO2 is stored in a liquefied state aboard ships within containers under moderate pressure (ranging from 7 to 18 bar) and at low temperatures (between -50\textdegree{}C and -28\textdegree{}C). CO2 poses hazards, including health risks, environmental concerns from boil-off gas generation and offshore release impacting marine life, and safety risks due to poor dispersion in low-lying areas. The research aims to facilitate a seamless integration of OCCS technologies and foster a sustainable and eco-conscious maritime future by offering insights into potential hazards, risks, and safety considerations.}

The introduction of multi-axial electromagnetic (EM) resistivity measurement enabled resolving vertical and horizontal components for advanced petrophysical analysis. This paper discusses the introduction of a new logging while drilling (LWD) digitally compensated closer to the bit multi-axial EM resistivity tool enabling improved petrophysical analysis, better coverage of the drilled open hole leading to faster real-time well-placement decisions and increased well productivity.  In highly deviated and horizontal sections, LWD is generally considered the most viable option for well logging. However, LWD sensors in traditional bottom-hole assemblies (BHAs) are usually placed at a minimum distance of about 35 ft from the bit due to the presence of a steerable drilling system between the bit and the logging tools which leads to relatively late petrophysical analysis of the drilled interval which can result in sub-optimal well placement. The introduction of an advanced near-bit, digitally compensated, multi-axial electromagnetic resistivity measurement located within the downhole steering system has proven to add value beyond addressing this challenge.  Closer to the bit resistivity measurement enabled data availability as soon as new footage is drilled which facilitates faster real-time, interactive well-placement decisions to optimize steering the well within the target zone leading to increasing productivity while minimizing hole tortuosity. The new configuration added value by resolving effects from nearby boundaries which can be utilized in petrophysical evaluation as well as projecting geo-mapping ``At-the-bit'' providing lithology indicator and fluid distribution through resolving vertical and horizontal resistivity components.  This paper presents the outcome of deploying the industry's first close-to-the-bit LWD compensated resistivity sensor, embedded in the rotary steerable drilling system demonstrating the evaluation of almost the whole interval of the well drilled, enhanced petrophysical analysis benefiting from resistivity measurements with minimal formation exposure time, timely preparation of the completion design by making real-time decisions on completion and isolation resulting in saving costly rig time.}

	abstract		= {Offshore drilling rigs play a crucial role in global energy production, particularly in the extraction of oil and gas resources. However, the industry's environmental impact has raised concerns about the need for energy efficiency and decarbonization in offshore operations. This paper aims to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with improving energy efficiency and decarbonizing offshore drilling rigs.  The first part of the paper provides an overview of the Energy Trilemma (Sustainability, Security and Equity) followed by an introduction on the importance of data collection and analysis necessary to monitor energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions associated with offshore drilling rigs. It highlights the significant energy requirements for drilling and mobilization activities along with the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions contribute to climate change and environmental degradation, necessitating clear actions for reducing carbon footprints.  The paper highlights the economic and environmental benefits associated with energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the potential cost savings resulting from reduced energy consumption and the avoidance of carbon-related taxes or penalties. Furthermore, it reviews a 360-degree approach to Offshore Drilling Rig Decarbonization embedding it into operations, operator-contractor engagements, and technical advances. It also emphasizes the positive impact of such initiatives on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainability, and improving the industry's environmental stewardship.  Next, the paper discusses the potential strategies for enhancing energy efficiency on offshore drilling rigs. It examines advancements in optimized rig design, energy efficiency upgrades, energy storage systems and sustainable behavior enhancements. Additionally, it explores the adoption of low-carbon fuels and electrification of offshore rigs. The proven and expected benefits, challenges, and implementation considerations of these strategies are examined.  In conclusion, achieving energy efficiency and decarbonization on offshore drilling rigs is essential for addressing the Energy Trilemma while it is necessary that the drilling contractor and operator work closely together in operating the business in a way that meets economic, social, and environmental needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By embracing innovative technologies, optimizing operations, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, offshore drilling rigs can significantly reduce their carbon footprints while ensuring a sustainable and responsible future for the industry.}

	abstract		= {The application of MPD offshore deepwater began on early 2010s. Although the technology is used for over 60 years onshore, the deepwater environment and risk demanded a new approach. Over the last 10+ years there was noticeable evolution of usage of MPD technology and the correlated interinstitutional development among different industries players, such as IADC, IOGP, API, among others. This paper presents key aspects of the evolution of MPD application, and the correlated interinstitutional developments achieved recently. The experience of 100+ wells using MPD on deepwater scenarios, and active participation on the creation of recent relevant international documents and committees provides the authors the opportunity to present key points of the recent industry evolution. Regarding the MPD evolution, a revision of the internal and external operations, through several papers and publications allows the identification of different factors that changed over the years while applying MPD on deepwater scenarios. A description of some of the documents released by several international institutions and impacts on new deepwater MPD projects. This provides an overview of the interinstitutional correlational efforts.  MPD operations are consistently being performed in deep water well construction for +10 years. Some even may advocate it has become commonplace. Current practices widely used today were unthinkable less than 10 years ago. The use of underbalanced fluid, where the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the well is below the open formation pore pressure, was one of the initial milestones of the application of the technique deepwater. The DPPT, Dynamic Pore Pressure Test, where a small amount of influx is planned to enter the well permitted the construction of wells with almost inexistent operational window to be drilled on a repeated and reliable basis. The expansion of the use of MPD for well control practices is relatively new but allows safer and quicker actions on the event of an influx. New forms of MPD usage are not limited to drilling operations, with successful results completing and on workover operations. Parallel to the development of the deepwater MPD technique different institutions began the development of new MPD documents. The objective of this ongoing development is to guarantee that the proper analysis and safety on the application of MDP deepwater.  This paper will present the recent evolution of application of the MPD technology on deepwater wells and make a parallel to the interinstitutional development of the industry. The objective of this paper is to provide a clear picture of the true capabilities of the technique deepwater and different industry documents. Giving the reader a broader understanding of the past, present and future directions that the MPD usage can take.}

	abstract		= {The casing system plays a crucial role in the integrity of oil and gas wells throughout their life cycle, providing tightness, stability, and support to external loads. This paper applies reliability-based models to the design of top-hole casing sections, taking into account uncertainties associated with soil behavior and casing tubulars manufacturing. Typical load scenarios are addressed to estimate the probability of occurrence of different soil-casing system failure modes.  Reliability-based techniques stand out as powerful solutions for structural analysis and design. This work assesses soil characterization data from piezocone tests (CPTu) to statistically describe some mechanical parameters used for conductor and surface casing design. Random variables associated with the material and geometrical properties of tubulars are also considered, based on tubular manufacturing data presented in API/TR 5C3 (2018). The probabilistic models are developed by using the First Order Reliability Method (FORM), an expedited and accurate optimization-based procedure, and applied to various load scenarios to estimate failure probability in the context of top-hole casing design. Finite Element (FE) modeling is employed for the integrity analysis of the soil-casing system.  Analyses have been carried out considering the variability associated with undrained soil strength evaluated from CPTu data, as this soil strength is expected to be the most relevant random variable due to its spatial heterogeneity. Other random variables taken into account are the outer diameter and wall thickness of casing tubulars, resulting from the variability in manufacturing process. Results indicate the feasibility and relevance of the proposed FE-FORM analysis in estimating the probability of occurrence of relevant failure modes defined following the oil company’s internal regulations regarding conductor casing load capacity and surface casing triaxial stress in the non-cemented region. For the specific case studies presented, failure probabilities ranged from the order of magnitude of 10-9 to inadmissible values approaching 50\%. Concerning how random variables affect the probabilistic response, it is observed that the outer diameter is not significant due to its low dispersion.  The novelty consists of considering both in-situ soil information and casing manufacturing data in a reliability-based framework that enables a more robust structural integrity analysis, supporting the decision-making process in top-hole design. This solution was implemented in the operator’s internal software and uses real data. Quantifying the soil-and-casing uncertainties by using a robust statistical-based methodology brings new information, enhancing knowledge about the variability of design parameters and its influence on the structural response.}

	abstract		= {The world's demand for metal is rising and new solutions must be explored to meet the needs associated with population growth, urbanization, decarbonized energy systems and circular economy goals. There is increasing recognition that seafloor minerals could help diversify the world's supply of responsibly sourced minerals and metals. As an example, polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean contain substantial quantities of nickel, cobalt, manganese and copper \textendash{} all are minerals that have been highlighted as being important for the energy transition. A number of entities are undertaking mineral exploration in the CCZ, and some are developing technology for the collection of nodules on a commercial scale. One of the key components is a lift system to bring the nodules from the seafloor to a surface support vessel/platform. This study examines the feasibility of using a modified marine drilling riser for a Vertical Transport System (VTS) for deep-sea mining operations. In particular, it examines whether it would be feasible to use such a configuration during a System Integration Test (SIT), a full-scale mining trial which could be executed ahead of commercial mining operations. This paper examines several topics including: Rated capacity of existing marine drilling riser joints and handling equipment.  Drill ship and drilling riser joint modifications.  The arrangement of riser joints and pump modules, including the influence on riser dynamics.  Effects of internal fluids on riser dynamics.  Operability of the riser within the CCZ metocean environmentModified riser fatigue analysis.  Initially a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters have the most effect on the dynamic behavior of the riser. Afterwards, many iterations were simulated with different variables tested such as pump locations, riser joint types, buoyancy distributions, etc., in order to optimize the design of the riser. After validation of the in-house simulations, the second phase of the study analyzed the riser dynamics including the effects of internal fluids while the riser is pumping slurry. The operability and fatigue analysis were conducted using a 35-year hind-cast metocean data set, based on wave buoys, satellites and models.  The study resulted in a riser configuration that provided high operability (\textasciitilde{}99.9\%) and sufficient fatigue life to conduct a test mining campaign in the Clarion Clipperton Zone. The proposed mining riser consists of existing riser joints and new-build joints hung-off on the spider-gimbal of the drill ship during operations (Hard hang-off). The existing riser joints need to undergo minor modifications to be able to reuse them for the mining riser. The riser modifications work with the vessel's existing handling equipment to deploy and retrieve the mining riser with minor changes.  The study concludes that a modified marine drilling riser offers an economical, technically and environmentally suitable solution for a deep-sea mining vertical transport system used during the SIT.}

	abstract		= {Water management has become a trending topic in today's operation in Oil and Gas.  The water breakthrough phenomena are even more complex when the problem occurs on naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR), where the challenging to perform a Water Shut Off (WSO) will raise on chemicals selection and placement procedure. The scope of the paper is to present the study and the application of WSO treatment in NFR with the increased difficulty of Subsea operations.  The WSO treatment was designed starting from the Eni experiences in NFR. The candidates were selected among the high water production wells in the field and a detailed analysis of the drilling performances, well sketches, log parameters and production data was conducted to define the suitable treatment. Several Business partners have been investigated, with the aim to select the best chemicals for the reservoir, taking into consideration the tight delivery schedule imposed by the production needs.  After the analysis phase, a detailed program was set for each well. The major observation to point out is the peculiarity of the application that implies several operations not common in Subsea well intervention activities, as Production Logging Tool (PLT) data acquisition, Coil Tubing Operation, Plug and Cement placement.  Some technical points have been identified as crucial to perform the job in an efficient way, as:PLT to verify the water entry pointsChemicals selection and compatibility study. In our application two chemicals have been selected to perform the job with different purposesCoil tubing challenges for chemicals placementAll the above aspects were included in the outline program and flowchart/decision tree have been made available to build a guideline for future WSO project.  The real novel of the paper is related to the complexity of every single operation selected to perform the entire treatment. The scouting of the market and experience in the industry highlighted that PLT, Coil Tubing Operation, Plug and Cement placement are risky operations in subsea wells and they have been combined to reach an ultimate goal, in our case of a successful WSO operation.}

	abstract		= {Subsea development projects face significant flow assurance and production chemistry challenges that require the application of chemicals subsea or downhole. The application of these chemicals via umbilical/downhole capillary string requires stringent qualifications prior to deployment to avoid system failure due to blockage or corrosion resulting in loss of integrity. It also requires properly designed chemical delivery system to ensure proper dosages and uptime can be steadily/reliably delivered for the chemicals to be effective, including proper storage volume, pump size/turndown, metering, chemical injection valves, etc.  The paper is to share the best practice of having an end-to-end view on properly managing subsea chemical delivery, including what can and have gone wrong if not followed. For example, chemical/material compatibility is a key qualification requirement for subsea chemical delivery. However, when requested for demonstrating compatibility with the chemical injection system, each chemical vendor typically have their own internal ``list of materials''. It hasn't been fully recognized that the actual list of materials that the chemical can encounter throughout the entire chemical injection flow path from transportation to tanks, pumps, injection lines, and mandrels/valves, can be way more extensive. Getting one compatibility wrong, it will become the Achilles’ heel and compromise the entire injection system and render the chemical treatment ineffective. Therefore, designing the chemical delivery system and qualifying subsea chemicals with an end-to-end view is crucial to the success of chemical treatment programs and oil/gas production.}

It was first developed with a floating production storage and offloading ({FPSO}) unit, subsea wells, and the first electrical submersible pump in the industry, moving subsea processing a giant step forward. After producing for 12 years, it became China’s first abandoned offshore field.  Recently, the field had its first oil for the second time, when the owner re-developed the same field using a different concept with a 19-km subsea tieback and new subsea boosting technology. In combination with an offshore platform, it enabled the economic development of the area for marginal fields.  The paper begins with a discussion of the development challenges of this field, and provides a holistic review of different development options, including a standalone development vs. a tieback development. It was pioneering act to adopt the first subsea boosting system, which has advanced significantly over the last two decades. In the past, the field was initially developed using five subsea pumps, with one for each subsea well. However, as a result of significant technological advances and maturation in the years since, it was more recently redeveloped using a single pump to process all flows. The comparison of the two development concepts allows for a rare opportunity to assess the impact of the technology advancement over time. The values brought by the technology are analyzed from both technical and operational point of view.  The re-adoption of the subsea boosting technology with a subsea tieback is of great significance to the offshore field development in China, where many marginal fields and long tieback fields can be enabled.}

Two module designs have been offered to the offshore service, with one targeting a more efficient fouling control with expanded surface area, and another targeting utmost compact design to save energy and space consumption. This new technology is currently available and has been used at offshore fields since 2020. With the replacement of the new NF membranes, existing SRUs can either increase by 10 to 16\% capacity without modifying the actual system or use a thicker feed spacer (34 mil vs. 26 mil), allowing for operation at lower Differential Pressures (dP) reducing Cleaning-In-Place (CIP) frequency and alleviating the hassle and downtime stress brought by fouling management. New systems can be designed with 9.1-13.7\% reduction in size for the same capacity when compared to standard SRU membranes. This paper investigates the benefits achieved in the real field on thinner NF membrane installation through the analysis of fouling control, production capacity boosts and membrane longevity extension. Existing platforms where the thinner SRU membranes are in use side by side with regular membrane product were tracked for direct comparison, which reveals remarkable gaining on energy consumption, chemical reduction, and downtime control with new thinner membrane installation.}

	abstract		= {Non-intrusive measurement of level in process vessels such as oil and gas production separators offers opportunities to significantly decrease installation and maintenance costs as well as to increase personnel safety and instrument reliability. This has a positive effect on process efficiency and reduces emissions. Provided the measurement technique can offer insights into levels of solids, emulsion, and foam layers, non-intrusive level measurement could potentially become an enabling technology for additional extensions of asset lifetime. This is because a non-intrusive profiler would be a game-changer for process and production control on assets in operation where retrofitting such an instrument is today prohibitively expensive due to its intrusive character.  A novel non-intrusive level measurement technique that utilizes Guided Elastic Waves (GEW) has shown very promising results in laboratory and pilot scale. This paper describes its development, starting with idea and leading towards the first full-scale trial on an offshore installation. The last experimental results, obtained towards a TRL4 qualification with an operator company, show excellent level detection of solids and liquid levels with virtually no error. Induced liquid flow had no influence on the measurement results and the signal did not drift when the system was left running for a month.  In addition to describing the experimental results and the technology qualification process, this paper also provides some reflections on the prioritization with respect to development and testing in the different stages of the qualification process. The prioritization is based on risk and cost benefit evaluation.}

	abstract		= {The North Brazil Current Rings (NBCRs) are a dominant phenomenon in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Guyana, which introduces substantial challenges and risks to offshore activities. Gaining a comprehensive grasp of the vertical current structure and variations linked to NBCRs is important for design and safe operations in the region. This study addresses the intricate attributes of NBCRs, utilizing data acquired from two deepwater moorings offshore Guyana. These moorings, equipped with current measuring instruments, were stationed along the pathway of NBCRs with the goal to capture their dynamic behavior and inherent variability.  One mooring was deployed in the water depth of about 1600 meters for 18 months. During this time, a total of seven NBCRs were observed, which were sorted into distinct categories based on their temporal and vertical characteristics. Four of these rings displayed surface current intensification, with peak near surface currents reaching 1.62 m/s. These rings were confined to the uppermost 200 meters of the water column. Diverging from this pattern, two rings exhibited a distinctive attribute\textemdash{}both surface and subsurface intensifications\textemdash{}with peak subsurface currents reaching \textasciitilde{}1 m/s at a depth between 200 and 300 meters. Finally, one ring lacked the typical surface intensification and only exhibited subsurface intensification (currents reaching \textasciitilde{} 1 m/s at 300m below the surface). Throughout the measurement period, a prevailing southwesterly-directed reversal current persisted within the lower part of the water column.  The second mooring was positioned in the water depth of around 1850 meters. Its 12-month deployment period overlapped with the final year of the first mooring’s deployment, therefore this secondary mooring witnessed the occurrence of four rings observed by the other mooring. The observations confirmed the occurrence of the distinctive current profiles: two rings with surface plus subsurface intensification and one ring with subsurface intensification only. The second mooring also demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of those rings.  This study’s significance extends beyond mere rings’ identification and description, unveiling the presence of novel current profiles with simultaneous near-surface and subsurface intensifications of comparable magnitudes. Additionally, it brought to light increased subsurface current speeds and distinct temporal behavior of these currents. These findings demonstrate the need for continuing measurements and modeling of circulation in the area to better understand and predict the events.}

ExxonMobil, Chevron, Talos, Denbury, Occidental, Repsol and many other companies are forming partnerships to take advantage of evolving business opportunities or government co-funding of CarbonSAFE projects.  The Gulf Coast corridor, onshore and offshore, from Corpus Christ to the Mississippi River presents a high concentration of CO2 from industrial sources and excellent storage reservoirs in the underlying Cretaceous and Tertiary sands. Analysis of the technical, geologic, economic and social aspects of this CCS opportunity is necessary for successful deployment of CCS technology and eventual attainment of NetZero goals.  To provide analysis of the CCS opportunity along the Gulf Coast Corridor, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has developed a CO2 Transport Cost Model and an Onshore CO2 Storage Cost Model. Nearing completion is the Offshore CO2 Saline Storage Cost Model. These models can provide comparative analysis of storage and transport opportunities for multiple CO2 sources to storage locations onshore, offshore or between either.  The Onshore CO2 Storage Cost Model is aligned with EPA’s Class VI regulations which are also applicable in offshore State waters. Carbon dioxide storage regulations for offshore operations in Federal waters are being developed, built upon existing offshore oil \& gas operations but are expected to dovetail with onshore Class VI regulations to minimize any conflicting requirements.  Financing CCS project development and operations is a primary challenge that is evolving towards a solution. A key component here is the 45Q credit, which in turn will support offtake agreements between a source and storage operations.  Initial industry interest in the Gulf Coast region presents an opportunity to examine business opportunities for deployment of CCS technology in this area, either onshore, offshore of both.}

	abstract		= {Recently, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) designated wind energy areas (WEAs) within the Gulf of Mexico, including six areas on East Texas and West Louisiana shelves. The objective of this study is to expand upon a previously completed BOEM-funded desktop study and focus on the geological and geotechnical conditions and the engineering constraints for the existing Gulf of Mexico WEAs.  This study focused on compiling public domain geophysical and geotechnical data to evaluate the seafloor and near-seafloor geological and geotechnical conditions relevant to offshore wind within the Texas and Louisiana Gulf of Mexico shelf in areas designated by BOEM as suitable for offshore wind development. Data available from published scientific literature and offshore projects were integrated and evaluated using Geographical Information System (GIS) and seismic interpretation software to identify and map geohazards, seabed and subsurface conditions, and key stratigraphic geotechnical units. Given the data publicly available, investigation for this study is focused primarily on WEAs within the Bay City OCS block of East Texas and the Port Authur OCS block of West Louisiana.  General sediment and subsurface structure vary between the East Texas and West Louisiana portions of the study area. The shallow strata associated with these areas reflect different fluvial and deltaic systems during the most recent glacioeustatic cycle. Both areas contain a thick unit of Pleistocene clay \geq{} 65 m thick with interbedded sand units of variable thickness, but often \textgreater{} 20 m. In general, the Texas and Louisiana shelf has been subjected to heavy fluvial incision and deltaic progradation since the last glacial maximum. Based on these and other conditions, the suitability of various foundation concepts are assessed and discussed.}

	abstract		= {This study presents a comparative analysis of hydrodynamics for floating offshore structures, with a focus on the coupled and uncoupled analysis methods for a floating offshore Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) support structures. The primary objective is to assess the impact of these two parallel methods on key parameters such as fairlead tension and platform responses. The hydrodynamic analysis performed for this study employs two distinct software platforms, OpenFAST by NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and MOSES by Bentley, and highlights the effects of using coupled and uncoupled methods for response characteristics of the mooring lines. The authors conducted a similar study on the fixed offshore WTG support structure. This study established a benchmark methodology for the industry to calibrate uncoupled analysis to facilitate the exchange of information between turbine manufacturers and substructure designers within the restrictions of intellectual property rights. The study proposes checks and balances to verify intermediate outputs at various stages of design development. (Gupta, et al. 2023).  In this study, VolturnUS-S reference floating offshore wind turbine semisubmersible designed by University of Maine along with International Energy Agency (IEA)-15- 240-RWT 15 megawatt (MW) reference wind turbine is used for the analysis. For the coupled analysis, an integrated global model of the floating hull structure with a WTG is modeled in OpenFAST and the coupled effect is captured by combining the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic responses. For the uncoupled analysis, response is generated by combining the hydrodynamic forces calculated in MOSES with aerodynamic forces using the AeroDyn module from OpenFAST. Results from both analyses are compared and presented in the paper.  The coupled analysis provides a comprehensive representation of the system's behavior, capturing intricacies of the coupled behavior of the integrated model. In contrast, the uncoupled analysis simplifies the system but may potentially overlook vital coupling effects. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the coupled and uncoupled analysis methods and their implications while providing valuable insights to engineers for the design process with respect to the varying effects of these methods on dynamic behavior of the integrated system.}

	abstract		= {Whilst the polyester rope is considered to be a matured technology that has been used as a mooring line in the offshore stationkeeping for more than 25 years, nowadays questions regarding synthetic rope constructions and its behavior still arise. One of these queries is related to the possible twisting that can be induced on the rope during the steps of mooring line installations. Although the recommendation of allowable twist can vary between manufacturers, the need to undo the twist to achieve those permitted twist levels could be a significant challenge. So the need to explore the behavior of synthetic ropes under those circumstances to refine the decision-making process is perceived. Industry experience states that the induced twist may affect the synthetic mooring rope performance, i.e., in general the breaking strength and fatigue life can be reduced due to the influence of torsion in the rope construction. However, even after many years, there is no sufficient data that provides the short and long-term impact of twisting spread over the rope. Eventually the questions that should be answered are: what twist level could be permitted without performance loss? What could be the impact regarding the rope performance if the twisting exceeds the recommended by the rope manufacturer? Different rope constructions might affect the twisting loss performance? As manufacturers, it is incumbent upon us to address these questions; otherwise, we will lack test evidence to guide installers in the face of practical situations that demand more than empirical experience during offshore mooring rope installations.}

	abstract		= {Offshore floating wind turbines experience greater pitch and heave motions than their fixed counterparts, resulting in component fatigue that reduces the longevity of the turbine structure. While various vibration control systems have been proposed to reduce vibrations, this paper proposes a novel non-linear tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI) system within the columns of the semi-submersible platform that is able to simultaneously dampen vibrations and harvest power from the vibrations. As such, the design essentially incorporates three wave-energy converter power take-off systems within the floating platform structure. Modeling of three non-linear TMDIs within the system was completed using a Euler-Lagrangian approach and optimization was completed using pattern search in MATLAB. The nonlinear TMDIs performed better than the linear TMDIs and tuned mass-dampers (TMDs) over the broader frequency range but underperformed the linear TMDIs and TMDs at peak loading. This indicates promise for regions with highly variable wave conditions; however, the TMDs and linear TMDIs may still perform better on semi-submersible platforms in some offshore locations. For identical vibrational performance, the linear and non-linear TMDIs required lighter secondary masses than TMDs. Additionally, theoretical power potential from the TMDI generator increased with the introduction of nonlinearity for most design cases.}

	abstract		= {Traditionally, verification of equipment and systems has been carried out by deploying surveyors to perform physical verifications. Today, the development of digital twins, representing physical assets, provides the possibility to leverage data to enhance and replace the conventional verification and validation efforts undertaken by industry stakeholders. Digitalization, new technologies, algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI), incorporated in digital twins, can be used to execute effective verifications. When such digital twins have proven to provide genuine and trustworthy evidence, the evidence can be used in assessments towards specified acceptance criteria, and issue, maintain, and renew certificates. Some parts of the assessment itself may even become automated through the use of algorithms and AI solutions, further increasing the importance of the rigor and intensity with which these digital twins must be qualified and assured. This paper is developed in order to support the development of trustworthy digital twins for data-driven-verification (DDV) systems and methods. Use of digital twins should be acceptable as long as they provide the same, or higher, level of assurance as the traditional methods. DDV also aims at reducing non-productive time, costs associated with surveyors attending the physical asset, redundant verification activities, and the knowledge sharing, and transfer burden imposed upon the asset organization.}

	abstract		= {Tubing conveyed perforating (TCP) is an essential part of the completion in many fields in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. However, there are many risks associated with the operation which can cause significant non-productive time (NPT). These are generally to do with not having visibility of what is actually happening downhole below closed multistage valves. Until recently there has been no real-time data available to understand this. In particular, the pressure reading below the closed valve has not been known. Different operators perforate in different ways as regards the pressure balance in the well, some prefer to perforate over balanced and some under balanced. Before the valve is opened the well is ``balanced'' to what is assumed to be the pressure regime below the valve after perforation. If this assumption of the pressure is incorrect then the well can either go on losses or can induce an influx into the well depending on whether you are overbalanced or underbalanced to the now perforated zones. This is further exacerbated if you are attempting to perforate several zones in the same run with different zones being at differing pressures in relations to each other. This can cause crossflow and backflow between the various zones making an understanding of what the pressure regime is likely to be more complicated. To counteract this then often in multi-zone wells each zone may be perforated separately with a follow up deburring run in between each perforation run. This method particularly on deepwater vessels can be time consuming and therefore costly, whilst still not knowing exactly what the pressure is under the closed valve after perforation. This paper will demonstrate how an acoustic telemetry and measurement system can communicate data in real-time below the closed valve and then back along the drill pipe to allow for safely managing the well if there is an influx. This allowed multiple zones to be safely perforated in the same run. Additionally, the system can be used for improving the torque and drag models for the subsequent lower completions runs which are difficult to manage in multi zone completions. We will show with data from a sequence of wells how this was introduced and implemented into the tubing conveyed perforating operations eliminating multiple runs and derisking the operations through the use of real-time downhole data. In particular how the processes were changed to deal with influxes over the campaign of wells.}

	abstract		= {Many oil and gas fields rely on gas injection for production support or disposal. However, methane gas injection in an offshore development is energy inefficient, limits throughput capacity, and requires sizeable infrastructure. Hydrocarbon transportation and processing result in pressure losses, which must be compensated for by multiple stages of compression. Subsea reinjection of methane-rich gas is a novel solution that could alleviate the downsides of the traditional topside approach. Subsea processing technologies enable the full reinjection process to occur subsea, without the gas stream having to travel to an intermediate topside facility.  The potential benefits of subsea gas reinjection are significant, and extensive study work and flow loop testing was performed to verify the technical feasibility of this approach. This paper discusses the selection of a subsea gas reinjection concept, system design, benefits, engineering challenges, and successful full-scale, low-density gas pump testing.  Subsea reinjection of methane-rich gas leverages qualified subsea processing technologies using arrangements that are flexible depending on operating conditions. The subsea gas reinjection system design incorporates high-pressure subsea separation to optimize efficiency and liquid yield, while subsea boosting pressurizes the supercritical gas. A comprehensive test campaign validated the ability to pump supercritical gas through subsea single-phase pumps, even for low-density gas applications. With subsea gas reinjection, system efficiency is increased because pressure losses are minimized, emissions are decreased, safety is improved, and flowline and host facility infrastructure can be reduced. Economics are optimized through facility debottlenecking and accelerated production.  Subsea gas reinjection is a novel, promising concept for offshore oil and gas projects. It uniquely repurposes existing technology to improve system performance while decreasing costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and complexity. Although system designs for the subsea injection of carbon dioxide (CO2)-rich gas exist, the boosting of low-density methane-rich gas for injection is unprecedented.}

	abstract		= {Lost Circulation is a well-documented drilling industry issue stemming back to when oil wells were first drilled, and today lost circulation still represents a significant challenge when drilling a well bore. Drilling a well bore using standard drilling practice uses a drilling fluid to act as a primary safety barrier, a drill bit cooling medium and a method to transport drilling cuttings from the well bore. The drilling fluid is continually circulated during drilling operation: down the drill pipe, back to surface up the annulus created between the drill pipe and well bore, drillings cuttings are then removed from the drilling fluid, and the drilling fluid then pumped back down the drill pipe. Lost circulation is where the drilling fluid pumped down the drill string no longer arrives back at surface but leaks into the formation through which the well bore is being drilled. Lost Circulation events can represent well control issues, significant drilling fluid costs, lost time in controlling and/or remedial curing operations. These issues are documented to add millions to the cost of drilling operations annually.  Lost Circulation is described using several categories that relate to the rate of the loss and mechanism of the loss event, these categorized descriptions are then used to catalogue and describe the types of solutions available to cure the lost circulation.  Lost Circulation severity is categorized by the volume of drilling fluid that is lost or not returned to surface. The widely accepted categories used are ‘Seepage’, ‘Partial’, ‘Severe’ and ‘Total’ Losses. Each of the four categories are defined with a fluid loss flow rate, some generally accepted definition rates are shown in Table 1 (Drilling Specialties Company, 2014).}

	abstract		= {In September 2004, within the Mississippi Canyon Area, a platform was toppled by a subsea mudslide that occurred during Hurricane Ivan. The platform was dragged off the station approximately 700 feet with all the associated well conductors buried under the sediment. Oil continues to flow through these conductors today, which is being collected subsea and sent to shore for recycling.  To permanently plug and abandon these wells using any top kill solution would require knowledge of the conductors’ burial depth beneath the seabed. Standard geotechnical survey methodologies like ground penetrating radar could not determine the depth of conductor burial. An Acoustic Corer1,2,3 survey was conducted to successfully identify the conductors’ location, orientation, and depth of burial.  The Acoustic Core2,3 device consists of a High-Frequency Chirp (HF), a Low-Frequency Chirp (LF), and a Parametric Source. The vertical position of linear features and anomalies is determined by converting acoustic reflection transmission-reception times to depth utilizing a velocity model representative of the survey site. Sixty-three focused Acoustic Corer scans were successfully acquired along four survey grid lines post preliminary scan processing; the sixty-three Acoustic Core data sets were then individually topographically corrected and processed as a singular large area seismic volume encapsulating the whole regions of the four survey grid lines. The data collected along the lines were combined, resulting in {3D} views of the sub-seabed down to a depth of approximately 200 ft, and the conductors’ presence, orientation, and depth of burial were highlighted with clarity. This paper will present the results of this survey and the implications of well abandonment options that will adhere to BSEE regulations.}

Firstly, well slot expansion technology of old offshore platform including hanging well slots inside and outside the offshore platform considering structure strength of old platform. Secondly, sidetracking new wells from old wells with low production is proposed to develop remaining oil near the old platform and sidetracking point is optimized towards deep to reduce footage. Thirdly, combined with reservoir, multilateral branch wells are drilled to improve oil drainage area and enhance oil recovery, moreover, branch bore open hole anchor and external packer are developed to hang sand control screen pipe and maintain wellbore stability instead of leaving branch hole without any sand control methods.  Well slot expansion technology has been used in old platforms, and 35\% wells slots have been added to drill new wells to develop remaining oil around old platform. In old well sidetracking, advanced sidetracking tool with high build up rate reaching 120 deg/100 ft is developed and applied in many wells including T shaped well, the sidetracking points have been moved down and the overall footage have been reduced compared with conventional build up tools, and single well construction period have been reduced by 2 days. Multilateral branch wells with 1268 meters long main bore and 2 branch bores have been successfully completed with open hole anchor and external packer to hanger sand control screen pipe, and the production rate is twice as that of the original branch bore without any sand control method.  This technology has been applied in Bohai Oilfield and new platforms have been saved every year as re-utilization of well slots, which can also provide reference for other offshore oil fields.}

	abstract		= {Time-lapse (4D) seismic is one of the most important tools for monitoring of subsurface reservoir production. However, repeated monitoring data is time-consuming and expensive. To reduce monitoring data acquisition cost and the subsequent 4D data processing, we developed three novel deep learning powered algorithms to solve challenging problems including sparse monitoring seismic data reconstruction, simultaneous source shooting monitoring data deblending, and rapid subsurface property estimation directly from very sparse pre-migration seismic data. These algorithms exploit the subsurface information buried in the baseline data and then transfer the learned knowledge to the monitoring data, which narrows down the sampling space of deep learning network to circumvent the network generalization challenge for optimal network inferencing. Customized network architectures and special learning strategies were designed to overcome specific challenges in each individual application. For sparse data reconstruction, we adopted a self-supervised learning approach combined with two-pass learning workflow to improve computation efficiency. A two-stage network was developed to enhance the deblending accuracy while preventing the non-uniqueness issue. A unique deep learning method was proposed to estimate the subsurface property change due to production or other activities such as CO2 sequestration directly from a few pre-migration seismic gathers without being contaminated by strong artifacts that are often observed using conventional imaging or inversion algorithms to deal with sparse gathers. The numerical experiments demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of these deep learning algorithms on both synthetic data and field data.}

	abstract		= {The electric submersible progressing cavity pump (ESPCP) lifting technology has the advantages of rod-free pipe offset wear, low energy consumption, high system efficiency and high degree of digitalization. It is suitable for heavy oil wells, sand wells, gas wells, highly deviated wells, horizontal wells, platform wells and other complex condition of producing wells. ESPCP was widely used in recent years, and nearly 1,000 wells were applied in PetroChina. However, deep well lifting has been the bottleneck that electric submersible progressing cavity pump is difficult to break through. The deepest setting depth of pump of ESPCP in China was around 2,500 meters. With the increase of the setting depth of pump, the lifting capacity of the ESPCP gradually decreases, and the failure rate also increases. The fundamental reason is that the current variable-frequency drive cannot meet the needs of long-distance motor control.  In this paper, the terminal voltage and output power loss of the motor under the conditions of different cable lengths were analyzed through experiments, and the reasons for the power shortage of the long-distance motor were summarized. A novel long distance motor control technology of ESPCP based on vector control and revised filter was developed in this paper. A new vector control model suitable for long-distance motor control was established. The angle between dq-axis and stationary coordinate was calculated based on three-phase inductance of motor to get the maximum armature current. The compensation model was built according to the load and cable loss. At the same time, the inverter voltage was increased to 1140 V, and the motor structure was optimized.  The validity of the model was verified by experiments. Through the long distance drive experiment of ESPCP with new vector control technology, the actual output power of the motor was increased by 40\% compared with the formed control method. ESPCP with this new control technology was carried out in Xinjiang oilfield, and the depth of pump setting was over 3,000 meters which was the deepest record of ESPCP application in China.  This long distance motor control technology of ESPCP provides an effective method to solve the low output power caused by long cable and overload, and the setting depth and applied range of ESPCP is extended.}

	abstract		= {Bohai Oilfield is rich in unconventional heavy oil reserves where the viscosity of formation crude oil is more than 50000 cP and mobility are poor. To produce heavy oil from formation to the surface and transport it to processing terminal is recognized as a worldwide challenge, especially for offshore oilfield for development cost.  Taking the development idea of ``Overall deployment, Step-by-step implementation, and Test first'' for technical research, the pilot test of thermal recovery was successfully carried out in Bohai Oil fields for the first time. Facing well head elevation and annulus pressure build up problems caused by high injection temperature (350\textdegree{}C), the low-density cementing slurry system is developed to ensure the cementing quality; Casing material and sand control method are optimized and selected to ensure wellbore integrity and sand control effectiveness, and other down hole safety control tools have also been optimized for high pressure and temperature.  The results show that after 28 days of bath at 350\textdegree{}C, the uni-axial compressive strength of the newly developed cement stone can basically be stabilized, which indicates that the cement stone has good high-temperature stability and well head evaluation problems have been mitigated. The proposed injection-production jet pump integration process is that the heat injection process and the production process use one set of production strings to realize the efficient connection between heat injection and production, and the operating cost is reduced. The long-term sand control technology for thermal recovery wells has been proposed, and 8 rounds of field tests have been completed with the sand content of the produced fluid is less than 0.3\textperthousand{}; The high-temperature down hole safety control system including high-temperature down hole safety valve, high-temperature thermal production packer and other key tools have been developed to build a safety barrier.  These technologies have been successfully applied in Bohai Oilfield, helping Bohai Oilfield achieve a breakthrough in the large-scale and economic development of ultra-heavy oil.}

	abstract		= {Hydrogen production using renewable power is becoming an essential pillar for future sustainable energy sector development worldwide. However, this way to produce green hydrogen is much expensive than traditional generation of hydrogen from fossil fuel called as gray hydrogen, so we need to identify effective pathways to lower this cost. Costs are currently driven by the price of renewable electricity and CAPEX to make hydrogen such as electrolyzers, but these prices are falling with more research and commercialization.  Most of energy consumers who use fossil fuels turns to electricity user to reduce CO2 emission. The electricity will be produced from renewable source such as solar, wind power, hydro power, etc. However, some industries including shipping and aviation cannot use electricity directly, because of energy density of batteries. Therefore, the electricity should be stored in liquid fuel for the industries through green hydrogen to LH2, MeOH or ammonia.  This study proposes the new concept for near-shore green hydrogen production platform The configuration of the platform is as follows; power rectifier, water electrolysis system, water supply system, brine desalination system (if needed) and hydrogen storage system. This study reviews the current state of green hydrogen production, including the advantages and disadvantages of different technologies and evaluates the factors that influence the installation location of green hydrogen production platforms, such as the availability of renewable energy sources, the proximity of the site to potential customers, and the availability of infrastructure. It also examines the optimization of the topside process design for green hydrogen production platforms, including the selection of the most suitable process units, the optimization of their design parameters, and the selection of the most suitable control strategies.  To develop this project, we have conducted research in collaboration with international specialized organizations from various fields. Firstly, for the topside process, we partnered with ITM Power, a specialist in electrolysis, and Linde, an expert in liquefied gases. HD KSOE participated in the design of the floating platform and the liquefied hydrogen CHS system. Economic Evaluation was handled by KENTECH and Fraunhofer. Lastly, in the field of rules and regulations, ABS (American Bureau of Shipping) was involved in the project.}

	abstract		= {This paper emphasizes the significance of adopting a robust approach for effectively handling spatially heterogeneous distributed data. We present a dedicated workflow focusing on enhancing the processes involved from acoustic reflectors data to surface and mesh definitions. Results derived from the robust approach are compared to the ones generated following a ``reference approach''. These distinct approaches are then employed as inputs for separate {3D} subsurface models for a reciprocal comparison.  The data on which this study is based pertains to the interpretation of specific acoustic reflectors from a geophysical survey typically related for subaqueous and sub-seabed engineering assessment. Generally, these data exhibit a significantly uneven distribution, characterized by abundant data along the acquisition lines and data absence in the space between lines. This distinctive distribution emphasizes the need to carefully consider the appropriate strategy during the surface creation phases.  The workflow commences with robust data simplification applied along seismic lines, followed by mesh refinement to improve surface definition. The resulting mesh exhibits a non-uniform resolution, avoiding uncontrolled sub-sampling, accommodating higher data density in areas with greater spatial variability and vice versa.  Comparing proposed approaches output reveals a strong level of correspondence, underscoring the reliability and efficacy of the proposed methodology. The benefits of employing proposed ad-hoc meshing criteria are evident in more robust sub-sampling of original interpreted reflector data, resulting in lighter mesh files and reduced computational time during mesh editing and successively {3D} modelling phases, all without sacrificing crucial original information.}

	abstract		= {Compact, and lightweight solvent-based CO2-capture technology is developed. The technology has undergone pilot-scale demonstration and extensive testing. The aim of this research is to systematically quantify the effects on the process variables associated with pressurized CO2-capture of flue gas streams or other process streams, encompassing both low and high CO2 concentrations. The objective is to verify the technology and to obtain the data necessary for the design of a large-scale demonstration plant, capable of capturing CO2 under real operational conditions. Results from four months of operation of the pilot are presented. The novelty of the technology lies in the CO2 absorption aspect of a solvent-based capture technology, utilizing static mixers and separators for contacting the gas and liquid phases. Consequently, the pilot scale absorption unit has been integrated into an existing solvent regeneration system. The solvent utilized in the demonstration is a 30 wt\% monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. Pressurized capture is benchmarked against previous research conducted using the same regeneration unit but previously done with a conventional atmospheric absorption column. The research project has performed extensive testing under atmospheric conditions, yielding substantial amounts of comparable data between conventional atmospheric CO2 capture and the new technology both at atmospheric and pressurized conditions. The results show a greater than 95\% CO2 capture rate both for low (2.5 vol\%) and high CO2 concentrations (10 vol\%). Further, the testing shows significant improvement of mass transfer of CO2 between the phases, and reduced size requirements both from a physical aspect related to dimensions of gas piping, but also with regards to the size of the absorption equipment (i.e., Mixer, separator, and piping in between those two elements). The results obtained have been sufficient to design a large-scale demonstration plant, and dimensions, size, cost, energy requirement and OPEX considerations of a full-scale system will be presented. The novelty of the technology revolves around developing a compact CO2-capture system that can be retrofitted into facilities that has existing emissions points, but most importantly, being able to enable CO2 capture on offshore installations that is not suitable for conventional technologies. The technology is likely to provide a significant cost reduction from a CAPEX perspective due to the reduced size and weight. Capturing CO2 in a compact way at pressurized conditions is likely to add great benefits. Gas turbines manufacturers are developing methods of exploiting the pressurized exhaust after the compression stage upstream expansion to facilitate high pressure CO2-capture, while preserving the energy. The presented technology can be an enabler in this market and bring down cost, size and energy consumption for gas fired power production with CCS.}

	abstract		= {The scope of the research presented in this paper encompasses over 25 years of cumulative experience in employing hydrogen deoxidizers within water deoxygenation process systems. Seawater is injected into the system to strip the O2 from water by means of inert nitrogen gas. In these systems, the nitrogen stripping gas is circulated in a closed loop and regenerated over a chemical catalytic reactor, where a purity of at least 99.995 \% is achieved. This paper presents empirical data derived from the operation of these systems.  A test system has been purpose-built to leverage several years of experience gained from hydrogen-fueled water deoxygenation in analogous onshore systems, with the aim of making it applicable to a new seawater deoxygenation system. This system is designed to purify a nitrogen stream, which is utilized to remove oxygen from seawater. Consequently, the nitrogen stream initially contains oxygen, and it is reused for the deoxygenation process, necessitating the removal of oxygen. The elimination of oxygen occurs within the hydrogen deoxidizer by introducing hydrogen upstream of a reactor equipped with a palladium catalyst. Hydrogen and oxygen react to produce water. The gas stream is driven by a liquid jet compressor, and the research presents operational procedures encompassing the control of hydrogen levels in the gas stream, control system considerations, safety protocols, and the regulation of other process variables, such as temperature, both upstream and downstream of the reactor. Notably, nitrogen shares similar thermal properties as hydrogen, and the reaction characteristics within such a reactor closely resemble the reaction in deoxo-reactors for deoxygenation hydrogen in Alkaline hydrogen production by electrolysis.  Results from hydrogen deoxidizer performance will be presented together with design considerations for generic hydrogen deoxo-reactors. Historically, this process has been driven by methanol offshore, and the paper will explore the feasibility of offshore on-demand hydrogen generation for the deoxo-reaction and evaluate alternatives for the supply of hydrogen such as storage solutions.  The novelty of the research is the combination of hydrogen deoxo-reactors with other process streams in combination with the seawater deoxygenation process.}

This IPL which can be installed as a second layer of protection between existing Hydraulic Emergency Shut Down (HESD) system and a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) rated High Integrity Protection System (HIPS), will provide protection against over-pressure scenarios in pipelines downstream of unmanned offshore WHP due to Electrical Submersible Pump's (ESP) deadhead pressure. A new IPL approach was developed for the installation of a new 2 out of 3 (2oo3) Pressure Indicator Transmitters (PIT) with a new independent Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) safety logic solver type, for improving adequacy, safety and integrity. This option utilizes power Circuit Breaker (CB) inside Automatic Frequency Drive (AFD) inlet circuit for ESP shutdown purpose. This IPL does not require extensive programming on the PLC, Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and it also optimizes shutdown requirements with minimum cable layouts, conduits, cable trays, fittings, grounding and cable tray supports. Normally, safety within a minimum acceptable risk is the main concern for the transportation of product oil to onshore from unmanned offshore WHP to Tie-in Platform (TP) and then to Gas Oil Separation Plant (GOSP). This approach would overcome challenges for the protection of possible rupture scenarios in topside piping, pipelines, flowlines, and trunk lines due to overpressure from WHP with ESP. Traditionally, only two protection layers are provided, namely, HESD system which is considered as the first layer of protection and a SIL rated HIPS. HESD comprises of electronic transmitter on each flow arm (initiator), Safety PLC (logic solver) for offshore multi-well platform and SSV (Master valve) and export ZV as final elements and the HIPS system is considered as the second layer of protection. However, the risk of scenarios of over-pressures still existed.}

In total 12 subsea motion sensors have been deployed in the campaign, covering 3 different locations (depths) on 1 off mooring line in each of the 4 mooring clusters. The mooring sensor data is combined with onboard vessel motion data and environmental data to feed a standalone digital twin. The purpose of the digital twin is initially to aid the understanding of the dynamic behavior and characteristics of the polyester mooring lines but could later be expanded to cover additional purposes such as operational decision support. The monitoring campaign is ongoing for the second year and the results reported here are based on data from the first hurricane season (2022-2023). Results for the first season did not include any extreme storms which means that direct seabed impact or other direct evidence of unexpected behavior in extreme conditions have not been observed. Instead, a range of results, including moderately severe sea states related to a hurricane, are used to establish and verify the digital twin, and explore sensitivities and variations in the mooring system modelling and polyester rope characteristics. Key results from this work are presented and the potential for further development is discussed.}

EN's {CFD}-based numerical wave basin tool (MrNWB), and the aerodynamic, aeroelastic, and servo-dynamic behaviors of a wind turbine are solved by NREL's wind turbine simulation tool (OpenFAST). The present numerical wave basin tool is called Wind Turbine Numerical Wave Basin (WTNWB) and is capable of providing wind-turbine performances and tower structural responses as well as 6-DOF platform motions and mooring tensions in high-fidelity. The coupled analysis demonstrates excellent agreement with the model test in the prediction of platform motions and mooring line tensions. WTNWB can overcome known drawbacks of two types of physical model testing methods: full physical model testing and real-time hybrid model testing. WTNWB is now ready to be used in FOWT projects for global performance analysis and is capable of more complicated test cases to consider blade elasticity, pitch control, and other possible sensitivity tests available in OpenFAST.}

	abstract		= {Safe and reliable access to offshore energy, whether it be through hydrocarbon or renewable sources, often requires floating infrastructure that is held on station by well designed, well installed and closely monitored mooring systems. The bounds of what is possible with mooring integrity monitoring technology has expanded in recent years, providing stakeholders with improved risk mitigation over the life of the floating facility.  GPS-based position monitoring systems are a common feature of offshore facilities. This paper presents how position monitoring data is being leveraged to go beyond excursion-limit alerts and achieve automated mooring integrity monitoring. The case study presented in this paper is for a deep-water spar facility that recently experienced a mooring line failure.  A numerical model was developed to represent the as-built condition of the facility and its mooring system. Static and modal analyses were conducted to characterise the response of the facility in both the intact and mooring line failed conditions. This characterisation was then used to tune an algorithm to detect mooring failures based on GPS position data for the facility.  In-field observations of GPS position data were provided to this algorithm as test data. The outputs of the failure detection algorithm using these in-field observations are presented in this paper. In addition to the algorithm being validated against an observed mooring failure, several storms were present in the data set, to test if the algorithm would raise false positive failure alerts; none were triggered.  The paper also discusses how mooring integrity monitoring can be deployed in practice as a 24/7 web-based automated system, accessible to key stakeholders both on and offshore. An outline architecture for how such a system may be connected to operational data sources is provided. Adequate consideration of data security and data integrity issues are important in the deployment of such a web-based solution and an outline of the challenges that may need to be addressed are provided.  By presenting a case study on how GPS data can be successfully used to monitor mooring integrity and reliably detect mooring failures whilst avoiding false positive alerts, this paper demonstrates an approach for improved risk visibility and risk mitigation for floating facility mooring systems, at lower cost and complexity than traditional mooring monitoring techniques.}

	abstract		= {Deep transient pressure testing, using a state-of-the-art formation testing platform, allows deeper investigation into a subsurface formation compared to previous wireline-conveyed testing techniques. Given the associated interaction of the pressure with more varied geological features, numerical reservoir models and simulations are generally required to capture the reservoir or formation heterogeneity that may be encountered during a test. However, the long computation time of such numerical simulation poses challenges for some critical interpretation tasks, such as model inversion.  We propose a novel method for the parameter estimation in geologically complex reservoirs by conducting Bayesian inversion with surrogate models. To account for the geology complexity, we utilize surrogate models constructed through the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method, to substitute for the numerical simulators. It allows simulating the pressure response in a timely manner while at the same time providing global sensitivity analysis for each uncertain parameter in the model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is then employed with the surrogate models for conducting the Bayesian inversion with pressure transient measurements.  We analyze the properties of PCE surrogate models and demonstrate that, for typical pressure transient interpretation tasks, sufficiently accurate surrogates can be constructed from an ensemble of 200 to 500 numerical model evaluations. These evaluations are performed concurrently in a cloud-based environment thus reducing the time-cost for surrogate model training to less than an hour. We then perform the Bayesian inversion on the pressure measurements and effectively characterize the model parameters with their associated uncertainties via the posterior distributions. The problem of MCMC inversion is solved in a few minutes using the surrogate models.  Through our studies, we demonstrate that the adoption of surrogate models considerably reduces the computation time required, allowing the Bayesian inversion to be completed within minutes, which was unachievable with the numerical simulators. Furthermore, this new method offers accurate parameter estimations and provides posterior distributions of uncertain parameters, as well as unveiling correlations among the parameters for the interpretation of measurement. These capabilities were lacking in the current inversion process utilizing numerical simulators. Finally, the new method lends itself well to workflow automation for history matching, thus reducing the workload on petrotechnical experts and addressing today's imperatives of faster and more cost-efficient field development.}

	abstract		= {A numerical formulation is introduced for modelling the dynamic interaction between the mooring line (chain) and the soil, extending to the connection point at the anchor (pad-eye) in a fully integrated analysis of an offshore wind turbine generator, floating support structure and mooring system including the anchors. The anchors and the segments of the mooring line in contact with the soil are modelled by macro-models. The macro-models describe the coupled non-linear relationship between incremental displacements and the resultant soil reaction forces at each node along the mooring line in contact with the soil and at the pad-eye in a 3-dimensional space. The calibration of the input for two distinct types of anchors - suction caisson anchors and fluke anchors in clays, is presented. By implementing these macro-models into a tool for simulating the dynamic behavior of the floating offshore wind turbine, the design process of the anchors can be faster and more accurate. Importantly, a holistic approach to the mooring system design, including the interaction with the soil, has the potential to optimize the design and reduce the costs. It also enables the prediction of the potential development of complex mechanisms such as seabed trenches during repeated motion of the mooring line in contact with the soil. An example is briefly presented to demonstrate the application of this integrated analysis of floating offshore wind turbines, emphasizing the additional input required.}

	abstract		= {Better sweep efficiency and larger drainage area in horizontal well design improves the well production performance. As a matter of fact, it is widely used in water drive reservoirs and tight formations. Horizontal well completion, in combination with mechanical water control design, influences the performance in a much better way. Water production is habitually a significant apprehension during the production life of a well producing from the heterogeneous carbonate bottom water drive reservoir with high permeability. Continuous increase in water production impacts the operating costs, economics of production and early relocation/abandonment. This paper focuses on success story of improving oil production from an offshore carbonate reservoir field through completion of inflow control devices (ICD's) with swell packers in horizontal wells. The adoption of this technology resulted in delayed/reduced water production and improved sustainability of oil rate and higher cumulative oil production.  The ICD is a throttling device that creates additional pressure differential when the reservoir fluids flow into the wellbore through this device. It is able to control drawdown to eliminate the water coning caused by reservoir heterogeneity and the heel-toe effect, so that the horizontal well liquid profile is balanced and the oil-water interface is uniformly raised. Selection of pertinent well completion system requires understanding of historical production performance with their completion details, possible sources of early water production, available methods for reduction of water production and efficacy of adopted measures for water control in the field.  This case study brings about the impact of ICD completion used in horizontal wells in the water drive reservoir wherein improved well performance; delayed water cut and additional oil production than the slotted liner completion has been witnessed.  Selecting the precise and appropriate completion method directly determines the future development and production options with improvement in oil recovery. This extends the well production life span with low investment to achieve more production. And thus, ICD's in horizontal well completion plays a significant role in maximising the economic benefits from field development strategies.}

	abstract		= {The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in the United States (US) has approximately 1,500 oil and gas structures that have reached or will soon reach the end of their oil and gas production phase and will need to be decommissioned within the next few decades. Decommissioning can be quite an involved and expensive process, but is required by both national and international law, and is also a required step in the U.S. federal offshore leasing process (30 CFR 250.1703). The decommissioning process includes plugging and abandoning of all wells, removal or preservation in place of all pipelines, removal of all oil and gas equipment, and disassembling supporting structures to bring back to shore which leads to the final step of site restoration. Costs for such decommissioning for individual assets can range from the tens to several hundreds of million dollars a. The P50 estimate for decommissioning of all current assets in the GOM is estimated to be between 34 to 48 B\\$ b, c. With the 1,500 asset assumption stated previously, this averages out to about 25M\\$ per asset in decommissioning costs. One potential mechanism to encourage decommissioning is to incentivize it through a repurposing initiative, known as Repurposing Offshore Infrastructure for Clean Energy (ROICE) projects. This has the potential to create a revenue stream from clean energy or other energy transition activities.  The responsibility for conducting and financing the decommissioning portion of the leasing requirement is based on the ``joint and several liability'' principle, where all current and previous asset owners remain responsible for fulfilling the ARO (asset retirement obligation). It is estimated that ten percent of the cost of decommissioning structures is covered by surety bonds, with the rest dependent on the balance sheet of current or previous operators. This often results in individual asset decommissioning plans being delayed for years while the financial responsibility is determined, assigned, and accepted.  An example of a ROICE project could involve fixed or floating wind turbines around an existing oil and gas platform, with the wind power exported to shore or used to generate green hydrogen (H2) through an electrolytic process on a repurposed platform. H2 generation by electrolysis will be supported by seawater desalination to provide a self-sufficient and constant fresh water supply. An alternative ROICE project scenario is to utilize a repurposed platform for carbon dioxide (CO2) injection and storage in saline reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a 45Q tax credit of \\$85 per ton. Of the different components of the oil and gas structures to be repurposed, it is likely the most cost-effective to reuse the jacket (main support structure) and the deck (flooring above the structure) for ROICE projects. In specific cases, utilities, cranes, and living quarters, among other things, may also be reusable with some refurbishments, The remaining equipment will need to be decommissioned as per normal practice and in compliance with the lease agreement.}

	abstract		= {Offshore locations present significant potential for geologic carbon storage (GCS). Key differences and benefits over onshore GCS include locations distal from population centers and abundant, high-quality reservoirs. Yet, offshore GCS projects also face major logistical challenges, such as metocean conditions and more costly operations. Co-saline storage is a proposed concept to defray costs and risks to candidate offshore GCS operations, while leveraging advanced U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), peer-reviewed models to support and expedite implementation.  Assessing for co-saline storage potential involves applying custom GCS risk and resource models to identify and quantify opportunities for safe carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into saline reservoirs while concurrently producing from nearby petroleum reservoirs. Co-saline storage allows for reuse of existing infrastructure, data, and project knowledge associated with hydrocarbon production.  Offshore GCS efforts to date have focused on either enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or dedicated saline storage. This paper shows how the use of artificial intelligence-informed models, optimized for offshore GCS and infrastructure risk evaluation, can identify co-saline storage prospects and offer economic and operational benefits for offshore GCS.  Over the last decade there have been advances in analytical capabilities that combine geo-data science, artificial intelligence, and domain science methods in multi-modeling approaches to improve evaluation and forecasting of risks and resource potential in offshore systems. These peer-reviewed technologies have been integrated into a workflow to assist with identification of locations with existing hydrocarbon production that are suitable candidates for co-saline storage. When used together with commercial data and tools, this geo-data science method can be used by industry and regulators to assess where and potentially how best to configure platforms, wells, and reservoirs to enable CO2 injection into stacked saline reservoirs while producing from existing hydrocarbon plays. This enables strategic reuse of existing infrastructure to defray costs and enable long-term CO2 storage in favorable offshore geologic settings. Ultimately, the co-saline storage approach provides users and stakeholders with data and science-based analyses to inform safe regulatory and operational decisions related to offshore GCS systems.  Decarbonization will require a range of approaches to meet domestic and international climate and operational goals. Existing projects and efforts have focused on single-approach efforts (e.g. EOR, pure saline-storage) to demonstrating the economic and operational viability of offshore GCS. This paper offers a strategic modeling approach for assessing co-saline storage potential (Figure 1). The approach incorporates existing offshore infrastructure and economic benefits from ongoing hydrocarbon production and plays to identify safe and viable GCS locations.

	abstract		= {As offshore wind assumes greater importance in global renewable energy, scour undermining the foundations of these structures becomes a critical concern. The issue of scour demands proactive solutions to ensure the durability of offshore wind turbines, considering the shift to sustainable energy across the globe. This paper outlines an integrated strategy to mitigate scour risks using interdisciplinary approaches. Details will be provided on how scour degrades foundation integrity and a review of current geotechnical engineering solutions, supported by case studies. The influence of currents, waves, and sediment transport on scour is highlighted with computational modeling to simulate these dynamic processes. Big data analytics is explored to enable rapid automated risk assessments using advanced numerical algorithms and predictive analytics. The study also analyzes existing mitigation measures and proposes enhancements to preparedness, rapid response, and training. Current regulations are reviewed for compliance, with recommendations to update offshore industry standards. The potential to apply these techniques more widely, including in the oil and gas sector, is discussed. Future challenges, including environmental changes and technical limitations, are noted. Additional research avenues include enhanced scour monitoring and new foundation designs. In summary, this paper synthesizes key learnings, recommends pragmatic next steps that can be taken, and forecasts the evolving scour risk outlook as the shift towards offshore wind expands exponentially. A collaborative and proactive approach engaging disciplines across offshore geotechnical engineering and marine geosciences is advocated to safeguard the vital role of offshore wind in sustainable energy, accounting for the complex challenges of dynamic open ocean environments. The proposed recommendations will enable offshore wind power to successfully become an integral part of how energy is generated around the world, thus supporting a green energy future that is sustainable and eco-friendly.}

	abstract		= {The oilfield technology of casing drilling in the form of Riserless Casing Drilling is being adapted to provide a robust and cost-effective anchoring system for offshore wind turbine and other floating offshore structures. As the world transitions from the global dependence on hydrocarbons for energy to sustainable, renewable electrical generation, hundreds of offshore wind generation stations will need to be installed. The development of offshore floating electricity generation has been struggling with its economic feasibility. One of the key issues is that increasing costs, due to the water depth and adverse subsea soil conditions, has been challenging project economics. Floating wind generated electricity has a key role to play in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, to be competitive and for its market share to dramatically increase, floating wind electricity generation needs to reduce its development costs to levels at or below that of competing sources of electrical generation (NREL, 26 Feb 2020).  Anticipated cost reductions will come from many project elements including increased capacity wind turbines, reducing the number of turbines required per project. However, these larger turbines increase the anchoring and mooring system requirements increasing the project costs. The current anchoring systems of higher capacity, which include suction anchors, hydraulically installed pile anchors and drilled-grouted anchors, have limited anchoring capacities. Increased anchoring requirements for larger turbines would require more anchors. More anchoring and mooring systems increase cost and increases the environmental impact. In addition, the current anchoring systems are not suitable for many subsea soil conditions, particularly hard formations, nor can they be installed in inclement conditions placing additional constraints on floating wind generation.  Subsea Anchoring System can provide very high load (pullout) anchoring capacities, better suited for all soil conditions, and can be installed in far rougher sea conditions. One advantage is that fewer anchors would be required, compared to current anchoring systems, for the high anchoring capacity requirements of tension leg platforms (TLP). This anchoring technology is a pile or casing drilled in to predetermined depth using casing drilling technology. It is a one trip system of drilling the hole with the casing to then immediately cement upon reaching anchoring depth. This system provides anchoring capacities determined by the drilled depth, diameter of anchoring casing and competent casing-to-cement-to-formation contact to provide anchoring capacities far exceeding existing anchoring. This operation would be done with existing mobile oilfield drilling units. The installation costs are more costly than the current high capacity anchoring technologies however since less anchors as required per floating wind turbine than current practices, including safety factor redundancies, the total anchoring and mooring cost would be reduced.}

	abstract		= {Offshore wind power has become a priority in the United States because it has the potential to unlock substantial resources to deliver both economic and environmental benefits toward a net-zero emissions goal. Recent analysis suggests that up to 2,000 GW of offshore wind capacity will be needed by 2050 to keep global temperature increases below 1.5\textdegree{}C. At present, there is no offshore wind capacity in emerging markets other than China, and established energy markets like that of the United States have quite a way to go before offshore wind makes up a significant percentage of the energy mix. Changing the status quo is critical if the world is to meet ambitious targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and change needs to happen soon. ``The long development timescales for offshore wind mean that efforts need to start now to ensure delivery of new capacity''1 (World Bank \textendash{} Key Factors for Successful Development of Offshore Wind in Emerging Markets - 2021).  Creating a supply chain is a challenge, but it also is an opportunity because it presents the industry with a chance to take a holistic approach to building out capabilities from the ground up to deliver a healthy, diverse and sustainable supply chain that enables large-scale deployment and can support mass manufacturing and well-paying jobs for the years to come.  This paper analyzes multiple elements of the floating wind industry based on the experience of executing two operating floating wind projects and how this experience and these elements influence the formation of the supply chain system with special focus on the constraints and opportunities in developing a supply chain that is reliable and sustainable.  Focus areas include: Addressing uncertainty in the pipeline of projects by leveraging policy incentives and understanding the regulatory environment and its role in expediting offshore wind projectsAddressing constrained space challenges and construction processes and planning for serial productionCombining resources to update ports and shipyards that are not equipped to support floating offshore windIncentivizing young people to enter the offshore wind industry and training a specialized workforceEstablishing technology readiness and suitability for mass manufacturing and large-scale deploymentReducing risk by establishing clear deployment goalsSourcing raw materialsSourcing products that benefit local communities.

	abstract		= {Offshore resources are a major part of the world's required energy mix and are currently crucial as a source for many materials and goods used in our daily life. The production and processing of these resources mostly relies on heavy-duty machinery and infrastructure that has been proven and running for many decades. Over the years the possible technologies used for the process evolved and equipment became more reliable and compact with longer step-outs. At the same time, electric actuators were deployed to overcome the need for complex hydraulic power supply and to increase monitoring possibilities while minimizing time lags in the system's reaction.  During the deployment of innovative technologies, a focus was put on the safety performance of the actuation systems. Due to potential risks to the environment, safety remains a key requirement for upcoming unmanned and autonomous production and processing sites.  Linear valves and actuators play a critical role in subsea systems as they allow for lightweight and compact design of infrastructure. The first electric subsea actuators for linear valves were expensive, large, and non-retrievable due to complex safety mechanisms using springs. The current actuators reduced the size by replacing the springs with electric batteries, leading to higher costs to ensure minimum safety integrity level with complex subsea control modules. This dilemma splits the users in two groups: the ones who prioritize safety by springs but have to maintain the environmental risks and OPEX costs of conventional hydraulics; or the ones who prioritize electrification by subsea batteries but limit its application to fewer projects which can afford a much higher CAPEX.  An innovative solution to overcome the challenges of the industry, following the state-of-the-art developments, was needed to allow sustainable and future-proof production and processing. This enables viable business models for rising industries such as Carbon Storage and green hydrogen production and transportation. At the same time, the solution had to be designed in a way to reduce cost and increase reliability and protection for the environment.  This paper shows the simplest way to electric automated linear gate valves subsea, without compromising safety and efficiency. It explains how a portfolio of lean all-electric subsea actuators was developed and qualified, focused on cost-efficient and reliable operation, by integrating field-proven safety with an easy-to-exchange module and low-power consumption drive, designed to scale up the energy transition.}

	abstract		= {An extensive de-risking program was conducted to qualify the subsea dense gas pump project design. As part of this program, a subsea pump prototype, a back-to-back centrifugal pump, was designed, constructed, and evaluated using a dense CO2/N2 mixture, referred to as dense gas. This dense fluid has a gas-like viscosity, but a density closer to that of a liquid.  The pump prototype was evaluated at varying suction pressures ranging from 150 to 200 bar, up to a maximum discharge pressure of 350 bar. The machine was operated at a maximum speed of 6,000 rpm, delivering a flow rate of up to 700 m3/h of gas mixture. The composition and pressure of the working fluid was selected to simulate Brazilian Pre-salt field conditions at the seabed. A vertical integrated pump-motor unit with environmentally friendly barrier fluid (BF) was configured using radial centrifugal impellers in a similar fashion as a multiphase subsea booster, to pump the homogeneous dense mixture.  The main objectives of the test campaign were to validate the hydraulic performance prediction and assess the rotordynamic behavior of the pump when operated with a dense fluid. Additionally, a series of slug tests were performed to prove the robustness of the pump in case of the transient high-load scenarios. The pump passed all the required tests and demonstrated anticipated robustness, which is crucial for subsea operation. The measured hydraulic performance exceeded predictions at high-load, high-speed conditions, which may be partly attributed to the conservatism in the selection process.  The successful combination of hydraulic performance, robust rotordynamic behavior, and an efficient control strategy provides strong evidence for the viability and effectiveness of the current subsea pump design for dense gas application.}

	abstract		= {Shear devices are used in the energy industry to control the actuations of downhole equipment. These devices must shear reliably at desired forces. The failure to do so leads to substantial non-productive time and workover. Due to design and environmental sensitivities, achieving reliable fracture of the shear devices is challenging. Design of Experiment (DOE) method with a numerical damage model was used to understand design sensitivities which enable reliable performance of shear devices. In doing so, a temperature-dependent elastoplastic ductile damage model was constructed and calibrated for a metal material. The maximum shear stress (MSS) damage model, calibrated with a single uniaxial tension test, demonstrated good performance in capturing the complex variation in critical failure strain. Implementation of the MSS damage model in {FEA} facilitated accurate prediction of crack initiation and propagation in shear devices. The numerical DOE studies on shear devices were conducted by changing various critical parameters, including shear plane, contact angle, engagement length, boundary conditions, and cross-sectional diameter. The results were validated through a series of experimental tests. The simulated shears closely matched testing results, usually within 10\%, and the predicted fracture surface profiles and fragments aligned well with experimental observations. The modeling technique was extended to case studies on actual shear devices, and experimental results were replicated accurately.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this paper is to outline the conceptual process design for producing green hydrogen from electrolysis of water, using electricity generated from offshore wind farms. This study exemplifies the production of hydrogen based on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis installed on the dedicated hydrogen production hub. The envisioned ``hydrogen hub'' represents a comprehensive green hydrogen production system, relying on a presumed 200 MW power supply from an offshore substation within an 810 MW offshore wind farm. The entire system is placed on a dedicated offshore three-deck fixed platform, which is between the offshore wind farm substation and onshore facility. The desalinated seawater is supplied to the PEM electrolyzer for producing green hydrogen. Hydrogen will be processed, compressed, and stored onboard. A high-level economics of the process design of the hydrogen production system will be evaluated using the open-source software. The paper is based on publicly available information on an 810 MW offshore wind farm as an example of a field case study.  This study intends to demonstrate the conceptual process design for green hydrogen production powered by an offshore wind farm. The hydrogen production process is designed considering the availability of surplus power from one of the existing offshore wind farms. The economics of the process are evaluated and discussed. Our design analysis shows that the process of hydrogen production appears promising and can be applied to commercial scale offshore wind farms. The current cost estimate of producing green hydrogen from the offshore wind energy seems economically significant. However, the ongoing technological advances show that the costs of hydrogen producing equipment and power needed from the offshore wind farms may reduce significantly in near future. The conceptual process design and high-level economic analysis performed in this study is intended to be a small step in understanding the economics of green hydrogen production and advancing energy sustainability.  This paper introduces a process design technology and economic analysis for renewable hydrogen production, utilizing offshore wind energy as applied to a field case study. This contributes to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and achieve net zero emissions goals. Leveraging expertise in offshore/subsea engineering and petroleum engineering, this research advances the knowledge and skills required for renewable energy production, balancing supply and demand, and sustainability.}

	abstract		= {The global warming has been focused as severe problem due to climate change, thus a large number of countries endeavor to reduce global warming gas. CCS technology is an inevitable option as long as the renewable energy sources cannot supply energy demand. The development of economical technology regarding CO2 injection is crucial for establishing a presence in the CO2 injection market. Therefore, we need to identify effective pathways to lower the cost of CO2 injection. This study's purposes constructing offshore fixed or floating type platform for CO2 injection with economical option. We conducted several case studies for CO2 injection system with additional process via process simulation, and the results indicated that high efficiency system can reduce electric power consumption by more than half. For the safety of CO2 injection system, we conducted risk assessment of solidification such as dry ice and CO2 hydrate via process simulation and lab scale experiments. The results indicated the risk of dry ice is affected from circumstance and phase of CO2. The CO2 hydrate risk is assessed by conducting a matching experimental data of batch reactor with experimental data of flow reactor. In addition, we conducted pilot-scale CO2 injection experiment to verify process simulation results and find consideration for design philosophy and operation philosophy. The results of pilot-scale experiment presented that various factors can be reflected in operation philosophy such as start-up, emergency stop. Furthermore, multi-phase flow was also considered during make up of designing pressure and temperature, which was also verified via fluid simulation. The overall results can be utilized to economical CO2 injection platform design. The results of this paper can introduce options to reduce electrical power consumption of CO2 injection system. In addition, the essential consideration can be conducted for designing CO2 injection platform especially in CO2 solidification and multi-phase flow.}

	abstract		= {Accurate geological characterization is crucial in offshore engineering projects. This study aims to develop an advanced methodology that extends the application of Cone Penetration Testing (CPT), providing a more precise and detailed classification of subsurface soils in the locations without coring. Then, the methodology integrates advanced techniques to achieve precise geological characterization. It initiates with a dual-parameter clustering analysis, a process pivotal in uncovering nuanced geological insights. Submerged unit weight and undrained shear strength, recognized as primary indicators, are meticulously examined in the designated coring sites. The K-means algorithm, a unsupervised machine learning technique, is employed in this clustering analysis. It iteratively refines the classification by strategically grouping data points based on their proximity in the dual-parameter domain. Then, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture is designed to synthesize the outcomes of the clustering analysis with the extensive dataset obtained from Cone Penetration Testing (CPT). This network undergoes a training process using a combination of current program data and historical datasets from various regions.  This integrated approach capitalizes on the strengths of both Kmeans clustering and neural networks. While Kmeans excels in identifying patterns and grouping data points in a two-dimensional space, neural networks are adept at learning complex relationships within data. By combining these methodologies, the study achieves a synergistic effect, resulting in a highly accurate and detailed classification of subsea soils. Compared to conventional CPT classification methods, our approach demonstrates superior precision and granularity. By incorporating dual-parameter clustering and machine learning, the methodology refines geological classification and description, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the physical properties of subsea soils.}

	abstract		= {The design and maintenance of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) platforms demand accurate global performance and structural analysis. Traditional frequency domain approaches fall short due to strong non-linear coupling among the turbine, tower, and substructure. Time domain analysis offers superior accuracy but requires significant time and computational resources. This paper introduces novel response-based time-domain global performance and structural analysis methodologies for digital twin applications.  The approach involves using Finite Element Analysis to derive stress transfer functions for various load components, including wave, wind, current, mooring, cable, turbine operating, and floater motion-induced loads. Load components are synthesized with environment and platform responses, and total stress time history is processed at each location. This methodology enables efficient calculation of structural strength, consumed fatigue life, and prediction of remaining fatigue life. The approach allows for simulation of the entire service life responses of a FOWT during the design phase and creation of digital twins.  Comprehensive prediction analysis during the design phase accurately estimates structural strength, fatigue life, and critical locations under various load cases. Real-time strength and fatigue analyses during the operating phase using digital twin models can be compared with predicted results, providing quick structural strength and fatigue damage assessments.  The present methodology considers all non-linear loads without simplification, ensuring a comprehensive load mapping and synthesizing of stresses. This approach contributes to the efficiency and accuracy of digital twin models and asset integrity applications for FOWT. The presented method serves as a valuable tool for both new design and ongoing monitoring, offering quick and precise structural strength and fatigue assessments.}

	abstract		= {The buoyant tower, or BT, is a unique concept that stems from, and is a hybrid of, spar and compliant tower technologies. A BT is composed of one or a group of cylinders anchored to the seabed by a single suction caisson foundation (SCF). The BT rolls in a compliant manner while keeping the base from moving in any direction. The first application of BT is CX-15, a production platform in the Corvina Field offshore Peru. The 10-year-long operation since 2012 has provided a vast volume of data and experiences that support the IP-holder to re-visit this concept for extending the design to offshore wind, i.e., w.  BT.  This paper summarizes a recent experimental and numerical study on SCF, one of the key components of a BT or a w.  BT, subjected to cyclic loads. Unlike most of SCFs used for offshore O\&G industries, the SCF of a BT or a w.  BT needs to maintain adequate load-bearing capacities after enduring repeated rolling motions. The vertical loads come from the difference between the weight of the platform and the buoyancy, which varies with the draft changes due to waves and tides. The horizontal loads mainly come from cyclic wave loads on the hull. These conditions are seldom studied, and little is known about the bearing capacity of SCFs under such loading conditions. Also because of the unique configuration of the BT, there is no design guidance available in the existing standards that are fully applicable. The current study aims to understand the reduced vertical and horizontal load-bearing capacities of the BT's SCF after constant cyclic rolling as well as the failure mechanisms of the soil surrounding the SCF. The relevant working conditions were studied with 1:100 geotechnical centrifuge model tests. The bearing capacities of the SCF were carefully studied with a focus on reduction of the SCF's bearing capacity subjected to cyclic rolling of the BT. The test results were also used to calibrate a numerical analysis procedure that will be used for the design of SCF for w.  BT.}

	abstract		= {The role of Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (CCUS) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for achieving global climate targets. Brazil, as a significant emitter, is actively pursuing CCUS projects and the state of Rio de Janeiro, with its high emissions of industrial activities, presents an opportunity for establishing a CCUS hub. The potential storage reservoir, S\~{a}o Tom\'{e} Deep Saline Formation, located in the Campos Basin, offers favorable characteristics for CO2 storage. This srtdy aims to estimate the CO2 storage capacity, perform uncertainty analysis, and comprehensive risk assessments for the Sao Tome reservoir. The methodology involves mapping potential storage reservoirs, {3D} geological modeling, and flow simulation to evaluate injectivity, storage potential, containment safety, and monitoring strategies. The results demonstrate a storage capacity of approximately 1 Gt of CO2, injectivity of 1.5 MMt C02/yr/well, and low leakage risk. However, further evaluation is required, including petrophysical characterization and geomechanical data. The proposal includes drilling a new well to acquire additional information and support more robust modeling. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would bring economic, social, and environmental benefits, attracting companies seeking environmentally friendly solutions and facilitating the development of the shallow-water industry. To achieve the Net Zero Scenario by 2050, CCUS plays a crucial role in emissions reduction, and the Sao Tome reservoir presents significant potential for CO2 storage. Continued evaluation and data acquisition are necessary to ensure the feasibility of large-scale CO2 injection projects. The establishment of a CCUS hub in Rio de Janeiro would position the region as a center of environmental responsibility and attract investment and innovation in the energy sector.}

	abstract		= {The aging pipeline infrastructure in the United States raises concerns about potential greenhouse gas leaks, corrosion damage, and catastrophic failures. Many pipelines are 30 to 60 plus years in service with an average age of over 40 years. The three main causes of pipeline gas interruption are material or weld failure, corrosion, and excavation damage. As pipelines age, these risks increase. In addition, there is increased interest in repurposing the existing pipeline networks for hydrogen and hydrogen-methane blends. Refurbishment of existing pipelines to prevent corrosion damage, and subsequent gas leaks and preparation for hydrogen transport will significantly accelerate decarbonization efforts.  Traditional approaches to refurbishing existing pipelines utilize coatings such as fusion bond epoxy or polymer-based liner. These materials provide corrosion protection but are difficult to install on active natural gas networks without significant service interruption. Often sections of pipe need to be removed for offsite repair and refurbishment. In this paper, the authors present a novel smart liner technology that is designed for on-site installation in existing natural gas pipelines. The goal of the liner is to be installed without pipe removal, avoiding major interruptions to gas service.  This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the development of an advanced liner technology with thorough characterization of the various layers of material involved and the performance against corrosion and hydrogen. The liner material, with various topcoats for corrosion prevention, was evaluated using linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under a CO2-saturated 3.5wt\% NaCl solution. Corrosion studies demonstrated an advanced nanocomposite omniphobic surface treatment with a corrosion rate of 0.5x10-6mm/year at a thickness of \textasciitilde{}20$\mu$m. In addition, the omniphobic treated liner showed strong adhesion strength and resistance against folding/bending.  Refurbishment, repair, and transformation of natural gas pipeline networks require new technologies that enable modification with limited interruption to the gas transport at a fraction of the cost of new metal pipelines. The advanced composite liner technology presented here offers a unique solution aimed at overcoming existing installation challenges for corrosion prevention, H2 transport, and leak mitigation.}

	abstract		= {Soil behavior assessment is an essential part for the design of offshore wind farm foundations, especially for those situated nearshore with layered soil profiles. This paper presents the key results and study findings of an offshore geotechnical site investigation campaign conducted for a large wind farm development project along the US Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore New Jersey, specifically focusing on the cohesionless soils encountered at the study site. As indicated by Andersen, et al., (2023), the static, cyclic, and dynamic soil parameters for offshore wind turbine foundation design include static and cyclic shear strength, deformation parameters, initial shear modulus, Gmax, consolidation and deformation characteristics, effective stress (drained) strength parameters, and damping. In this paper, the conventional index and physical properties for the cohesionless soils are discussed together with the stress history (overconsolidation ratio, OCR), deformation (static secant modulus, E50), and permeability characteristics and dynamic initial shear modulus (Gmax)evaluated from the in situ cone penetration tests (CPTs) and onshore laboratory testing. The undrained and drained shear strength parameters (effective peak friction angles, residual friction angles, and dilation angles) and strength anisotropy from direct shear (DS), direct simple shear (DSS), and triaxial tests of the cohesionless soils are addressed.  Results of the soil/steel interface residual strength measured from a suite of ring shear tests on reconstituted cohesionless samples using a Bishop apparatus are detailed herein. Additionally, soil erosion function apparatus (EFA) tests were performed on selected cohesionless samples to investigate the threshold seabed stress ($\tau{}$cr) and scour rates for the use of sediment mobility potential assessment. The EFA test results are compared and discussed with empirical shields diagram and correlations.  This paper provides a thorough overview of the static and dynamic soil properties of the US Atlantic OCS cohesionless soils for offshore wind farm foundation design. Comparisons of the soil properties with those published for the soils in other regions also are included.}

It combines innovative concepts and technologies aiming to deal with challenges faced during the execution of B\'{u}zios 1 to 4 Projects, producing since 2018.  A robust concept of Subsea, Umbilicals, Risers, and Flowlines (SURF) was implemented associated with an execution strategy designed to reduce the risk of unpreparedness. The strategy integrates critical path analysis, schedule monitoring, and controlling mechanisms to mitigate risks of lack of readiness, streamlining well connections for {FPSO} (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) ramp-up. Besides that, rigid jumper metrology was taken out of the critical path through the application of indirect metrology between the PLET (Pipeline End Termination) Hub and the Xmas Tree.  The subsea scope was effectively divided into two primary components: an EPCI (Engineering Procurement Construction and Installation) contract for rigid pipe delivery and the utilization of Petrobras’ chartered PLSVs (Pipe Laying Support Vessel) for flexible installation. This approach optimized the installation schedule, ensuring efficient vessel allocation through integrated time, scope, and space monitoring.  The project introduced novel technologies through its {FPSO}, enhancing H2S removal from the gas export stream using an environmentally friendly solution\textemdash{}a selective membrane system. This innovation promises reduced solid bed consumption, leading to decreased waste disposal throughout the unit's lifecycle.  The methodologies presented help to enhance future offshore endeavors. It outlines a robust SURF concept and execution strategy, minimizing readiness risks and hastening {FPSO} ramp-up. The integration of critical path analysis, monitoring, and time-scope-space tools offers a distinct approach to concurrent operations. Innovative metrology and H2S removal advancements enhance efficiency and environmental sustainability, respectively.  The first oil of the Project was on May 31st, 2023, and the maximum capacity of the {FPSO} (150,000 bpd) was achieved just 146 days after that on October 24th, 2023, a Petrobras’ record. The achievement of these milestones is in line with the sound development plan of B\'{u}zios Field, which will reach a production of about 1.8 million bpd by 2028, when there will be eleven {FPSO}s in operation at the area.}

	abstract		= {Decommissioning decision-making is an integral and complex process in various industries, such as nuclear power plants, oil and gas facilities, and industrial manufacturing plants. The planned service life of many offshore oil and gas facilities is coming to an end. Decommissioning these facilities has emerged as a crucial task due to significant and uncertain expenses, high operational risks, potential social consequences, and environmental considerations related to the marine ecosystem. This paper proposes an evolving methodology to assist a sustainably oriented decision process for decommissioning the subsea infrastructure of offshore oil and gas facilities.  Decision-making plays a crucial role in the search for a balance between the concerns of stakeholders, such as oil and gas companies, government bodies, environmental protection organizations, marine and coastal environmental users, and local communities. The decision problem is often complex since, most of the time, no ideal option is available to satisfy all criteria. Decision-makers can employ advanced approaches to address this problem, such as the multi-criterion decision analysis presented in this work. This methodology improves the decision-making process by ranking the various options for decommissioning subsea oil and gas assets. The model considers six criteria: Safety, Environment, Waste Management, Technical, Social, and Economic. Multiple decommissioning alternatives are compared, where groups of structures with similar technical and environmental characteristics are identified and analyzed together.  The paper summarizes the application of this methodology in decommissioning different fields off the Brazilian coast, demonstrating excellent performance in helping the decision-making process.  The methodology proposed addresses the growing concern about properly disposing of the decommissioned materials in an environmentally responsible manner with guidance from life-cycle assessment methods. Furthermore, attention is given to sustainability-related concerns regarding emissions generated during decommissioning operations. A set of tools was developed to help the stakeholders to have a better understanding of the results. The methodology contributes to reducing the subjectivity of the decision by assisting a project that is still conceptual to make decisions based on solid foundations raised through various databases and specialist knowledge.}

	abstract		= {In the current drilling and completions market, operators are requiring fluids that minimize reservoir damage, stimulate while drilling, completing, and cementing wells, and drive reduction in carbon footprints.  Reservoir impediment due to incompatibility between the native reservoir fluids and the drill-in, completion, and cementing fluids is a common cause of damage in depleted formations. High fluid invasion during the various phases of the well construction can further exacerbate these incompatibilities.  Compatibility studies between reservoir and wellbore construction fluids built from industrial waters should be analyzed in detail and tested extensively before starting operations. A detailed compositional analysis (including cation, anions, and functional groups) of the water used to prepare the fluids is required to prevent scale deposition and emulsion formation.  To maintain reservoir permeability and minimize damage from fluid incompatibilities, emulsion formation should also be minimized by using fluids with the ability to maintain the water-wet condition of the reservoir and reduce interfacial tension (IFT) between the crude oil and water-based fluids thus reducing capillary pressures. Additionally, the bridging and weighting solids should be properly sized to prevent plugging of the rock pore throat, as well as minimizing solids accumulated while drilling.  This paper discusses the efficacy of formation damage prevention by combining and adding an IFT reducer, a scale inhibitor, and a fines migration preventer into the drill-in and completion fluids. Several tests were performed to prove the concept, including return permeability using a sequence of fluids (reservoir, drill-in, and completion fluids), interfacial tension measurements, and compatibility analysis.  Laboratory data have shown that pH changes generated by some filtrates invading the near-wellbore area, such as cement filtrate, drastically increase chemical reactions and promote scale formation. It was possible to see the nucleation and salt precipitation processes by extending the evaluation time from 8h to 24h. In consequence, the effective flow area in the near-wellbore is reduced by scale formation, impeding the production.  Studies were focused on the compatibility between reservoir fluids and drill-in and completion fluids. The combination of the IFT reducer, scale inhibitor, and fines stabilizer in the water-based fluids resulted in minimization of formation damage by preventing scale formation and fines mobilization and by minimizing the potential for emulsion formation by reducing interfacial tension and controlling high capillary forces present in very low permeable formations.  A baseline return permeability test (without enhancer package) showed around 25\% reduction in permeability after exposure to the drill-in fluid and/or completion fluid, but when the IFT reducer and scale inhibitor are added, the return permeability is only reduced \textless{}10\%. The combination of products helps to reduce formation damage and promote good permeability in the near wellbore area.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry is facing significant challenges with aging offshore units approaching the end of their service life. At this point, life extension or decommissioning becomes a strategically important decision. For the decommissioning pathway, in addition to safety concerns and financial impacts, the industry needs to perform their dismantling and recycling in a sustainable manner. Decommissioning and recycling projects involve aspects such as safety, environmental, regulatory, legal, and financial, all with complex interfaces and different risk levels. Effective planning is essential to enable the achievement of green recycling, targeting zero pollution and an accident-free environment. With the recent ratification of the Hong Kong Convention for ship recycling, increased attention from stakeholders will be given to the sustainable development goals ahead of the June 2025 effective date. Key steps followed by the integrated management of the project from the end-of-life decision to final waste disposal certificate are essential and will be addressed in this paper. Recognizing that green decommissioning of large offshore facilities is a complex task and mostly an untested field, rather than proposing generic discussions of the challenges that might be faced during decommissioning projects, this paper introduces the main topics by leveraging the expertise of experienced professionals. This paper reviews the technical, operational, and regulatory aspects of complex decommissioning projects and presents an informed process to mitigate the associated risks, as well as efficient management to achieve safety and sustainable KPIs within budget and performance levels. Then, it identifies the main challenges for sustainable decommissioning and recycling of offshore facilities and addresses solutions to mitigate them. Then best practices are proposed to manage the risks to successful completion in a safe manner and achievement of the important goal of a sustainable decommissioning and recycling process. The paper also discusses the main steps in executing a successful decommissioning and recycling project, covering identification of key drivers, efficient planning, and project strategies to mitigate risks.}

	abstract		= {Determining formation tops in hydrocarbon wells is a critical aspect of drilling operations, impacting decisions related to casing setting depths and drilling fluid design. Traditionally, estimates are made based on geological data during the exploration phase, but these lack precision. Real-time updates to formation tops occur as new wells are drilled, incorporating data from various measurements like Rate of Penetration (ROP), gamma ray, formation cuttings, and mud logging. However, these measurements come with limitations such as high costs, manpower requirements, and time or depth lags.  This study introduces an innovative alternative using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to accurately predict formation tops. The ANNs model incorporates drilling mechanical parameters and ROP to address limitations in existing techniques, aiming to predict genuine ROP changes irrespective of other drilling parameter fluctuations. Real-field data from two Middle Eastern vertical oil wells was utilized to validate this approach. The study explored different smoothing techniques and identified the moving average technique with a span of 5 as effective in smoothing data while preserving structure.  The ANNs model was trained with 70\% of Well-A’s data and tested on the remaining 30\%, with validation using Well-B data. The sensitivity analysis revealed that an ANNs model with 25 neurons and one hidden layer, using the trainlm training function, achieved optimal results. For testing data from Well-A and the validation date of Well-B, correlation coefficients (R) were 0.94 and 0.98, respectively. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective solution, overcoming challenges associated with traditional methods. It provides accurate, real-time predictions for formation tops during well drilling, ensuring better decision-making in casing programs and drilling fluid design, ultimately contributing to more efficient and cost-effective well operations.}

	abstract		= {World's 70\% of the hydrocarbon production occurs from mature oil and gas fields and many of such oil rigs and platforms in the world are nearing their ``end of life'' phase, and subsequent decommissioning and abandonment plans are being prepared. There is a necessity in the industry for early planning for the forecasted \\$100 billion global decommissioning activities of oil and gas facilities along with their associated midstream and downstream industries for risk management and cost optimization. Decommissioning in the offshore oil and gas industry involves the permanent closure and removal of facilities and infrastructure that are no longer economically viable or have reached the end of their operational life. This comprehensive process encompasses the cessation of production, plugging and abandoning wells, and the dismantling or removal of offshore platforms, pipelines, and associated structures. The process is highly regulated to ensure the safety of personnel, protect the environment, and comply with local and international regulations, reflecting the increasing importance of decommissioning as oil and gas fields globally age.  The decommissioning of offshore oil and gas facilities poses several technical, operational, social, economic and environmental challenges and it is imperative to address complicated and frequently costly process and also to minimize the damage caused to the environment. Lack of experience and difficulties in estimating liabilities and costs are major challenges in decommissioning and depending on the age, location, and compliance with safety and environmental standards of the facility, potential expenses could run into the billions of dollars. Assumptions about Cessation of Production (CoP), timelines for decommissioning operations, procedural elements, and inflation accounting are all part of the estimation process for decommissioning costs. Liabilities associated with decommissioning are complex, impacted by laws, regulations, contractual terms, and public perception. Other difficulties include ensuring sufficient financial assurance to finish projects and controlling safety and environmental risks during decommissioning. Since operators usually receive little to no revenue from decommissioning projects, obtaining adequate funding becomes essential to the successful completion of decommissioning operations.  Decommissioning can cause a disturbance of habitat during the removal of platforms, pipelines and subsea equipment. Residual hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and other chemicals may be present in the decommissioned infrastructure. Noise and vibrations during the decommissioning activities can affect marine mammals and fish. During decommissioning a large amount of waste materials and loose are produced. The disposal of decommissioned materials, including steel structures, concrete, and other materials, needs to be carefully managed to avoid negative environmental impacts. Decommissioning activities, such as the cutting and handling of pipelines and other equipment, also carry the risk of accidental oil or chemical spills. Thus, during Decommissioning Hazard (DEHAZ) study, it is imperative to identify and account for the waste generated during the operation and how it is disposed (Shaw,1994). The goal is to ensure that decommissioning activities are carried out in an environmentally responsible manner, minimizing harm to marine ecosystems and maintaining overall environmental sustainability.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes the design methodology implemented during the wellhead system development for the Petrobras B\'{u}zios project. The project required an increase in the subsea wellhead system's capabilities, including pressure containment, load-carrying capacities, and endurance testing, surpassing those of past projects. The wellhead system included components featuring a reduced outside diameter of the equipment that allows the wellhead components to be deployed through the Production Adapter Base (PAB) which will eliminate Blowout Preventer (BOP) trips, leading to a savings of up to five days per well.  A fit-for-purpose wellhead system was developed for use with a PAB that incorporated enhanced performance in structural loading and endurance that leveraged new sealing technology, combining cost reduction in well construction with an increase in integrity. The wellhead system has been fully verified using advanced analysis tools and validated with full-scale load and pressure testing to endurance cycle standards defined by the B\'{u}zios life-of-field performance. Industry leading seal validation standards were set for the project and met to account for strenuous operational design requirements. Total system development included the system hardware design, validation testing, bore protection equipment design, and installation tooling design.  The full wellhead system was designed by analysis and utilized {3D} models to accurately capture load distribution and interaction of the complex components within the system assemblies. Further refined analysis was used to optimize performance based upon validation test results that led to successfully completing all seal validation requirements to the Petrobras specifications inclusive of a 200-cycle endurance test followed by performance envelope validation. In addition, the system further met the high operational and technical standards of other Dril-Quip subsea wellhead systems, such as single trip installations of casing hangers and seal assemblies. The system does not require additional lockdown devices to be installed either in tandem or separately while meeting 1.8-million-pound hanger and Seal Assembly lockdown requirements. Eliminating the need for extra lockdown devices has the potential to further expedite well construction by approximately one day.  The B\'{u}zios project requirements challenged equipment providers to explore new methods of learning and design optimization to meet the overall project schedule. The final output required to meet the project challenge was a new 18-3/4{''} \texttimes{} 16-5/8{''} 15,000 psi rated wellhead system that provides the industry with the highest combination of pressure capacity, lockdown capacity, and endurance testing. This pivotal technology is instrumental in enhancing operational savings by eliminating both BOP (Blowout Preventer) trips and the lockdown sleeve trip, thereby unlocking greater efficiency in operations. In this paper, we delineate the multifaceted challenges encountered in the development of the 18-3/4`` \texttimes{} 16-5/8'' Drill Through Subsea Wellhead System and highlight the innovative solutions that were devised to overcome these obstacles. An in-depth exploration of the engineering hurdles is presented, alongside a description of the systematic approach and novel methodologies employed to ensure the project's success and its alignment with the stringent requirements of the B\'{u}zios field development. Furthermore, these advancements not only underscored Dril-Quip's commitment to engineering excellence but also established the company as the first to market with this pioneering technology, setting a new benchmark in the industry.}

	abstract		= {Steel catenary risers (SCRs) have traditionally been the preferred choice in offshore applications due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, in deep water with more challenging production conditions, SCRs present unique design challenges related to riser payloads and touch-down point (TDP) strength and fatigue responses. In contrast, steel lazy wave risers (SLWRs) have been gaining popularity as an alternative solution. This is primarily attributed to their ability to reduce the payload requirements on the host vessel and their capacity to effectively manage strength and dynamic response at the riser TDP. Nonetheless, the adoption of SLWRs introduces its own set of design complexities, including in mitigating slugging fatigue damage when transporting multiphase oil and gas through the SLWR system and interference with adjacent structure.  This paper focuses on the optimization design and analysis for a SLWR to meet strength, interference, fatigue design criteria considering extreme environmental loads and all fatigue sources while maintaining economic feasibility. OrcaFlex (Orcina 2022) is utilized to conduct strength, interference, and fatigue analyses for a series of riser configurations. To enhance analysis efficiency and reduce computational time, wave fatigue analyses are performed in the frequency domain.  Strength analysis results, obtained through nonlinear finite element simulations, are crucial for assessing the feasibility of proposed configurations. These results offer valuable insights into key parameters, such as the riser pipe size, hang-off angle, hang-off location on the vessel, sag bend and hog bend elevations, and azimuth angle. Among these parameters, sag bend height and arch height are identified as pivotal in defining the SLWR configuration. Total fatigue damages, encompassing installation fatigue damage, vortex induced vibration (VIV) and heave induced vibration (HVIV) fatigue damage, wave-induced vessel motion fatigue (WIF) damage, and slugging fatigue damage, are calculated. Mitigation methods based on the fatigue damage results are discussed.  SLWRs offer the advantage of reducing the payloads to the vessel while effectively mitigating critical stress and potential compressive forces at TDP. The slugging fatigue damage can be of significant concern when dealing with slug flow conditions. This paper introduces an enhanced and more efficient method for the development of SLWR configurations. Implementing this method, the buoyancy section length can be optimized. This, in return, leads to substantial reductions in project costs, making SLWRs a more economically viable choice.}

This final assembly industrialization process, called Smart Yard (patent pending), applies a production line philosophy where the work is split among optimized workstations minimizing the duration of the operations, the space required, and the number of resources necessary with a positive impact on the project economics and timeline.  The Smart Yard production process approach it’s optimized for Saipem’s STAR1 semi-submersible design, and intended to be accommodated on a number of US ports (present and future) and it will contribute to the cost-efficiency necessary for floating wind to take off in US, while supporting the development of a American fabrication value-chain for floating wind. The Saipem’s STAR1 final assembly process has been split up in an exhaustive sequence of elementary tasks. Those tasks and the different tools and techniques available on the market to perform them have been analyzed to select the most appropriate ones and define the duration and methodologies applicable to each task.  The Smart Yard assembly process applied for STAR1 has resulted in the definition of typically 3- 4 workstations. A customized equipment shall handle parts alignment in combination with a real time laser alignment method ensuring a perfect fit. Dedicated access and fabrication towers fitted with the selected welding technologies and real time NDE shall minimize the joining time eliminating reworks. The handling philosophy rely on the use of SPMTs/skidding which results in a great flexibility and operations easiness.  The area required is minimized, and with no need for oversized cranes deployment, the facility can be installed on a temporary basis and easily relocated. Additionally, the technology content and tasks specialization allow for fast workforce training. This type of production philosophy opens the path for a serial and mass production plant development tailored on the floating foundation product category.}

This new approach utilizes a volatile organic compound (VOC)-free, water-based ``omniphobic" material that has previously been developed and evaluated for the transport of liquid natural gas. Through the incorporation and refinement of both application techniques and material composition, several new features were added to the initial coating material properties: (1) drag reduction when transporting water or water-based products, (2) resistance to abrasion stemming from entrained solids, (3) UV-resistance to embrittlement and photodegradation, and (4) applicability through spray atomization.  In this paper, we present several case studies to demonstrate the coating application method \textendash{} an atomized spray application qualified by inspection of the surface to identify applied thickness, coating holidays, and any anomalies. We document how the material can reduce frictional drag forces by 20\% over an untreated pipeline, a 5\% improvement over a traditional thick epoxy flowcoat material, while showing no abrasive wear even with a flow product containing up to 5\% solids. The potential for this coating to also serve as an external corrosion protection solution will be shown, as demonstrated via arc-xenon ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure of 1,000 hours and field validation at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport's "reef runway'' in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Surfaces protected by the nanocomposite retained their gloss coating and hydrophobicity comparable to pre-UV exposure values. The nanocomposite coating material can deliver substantial cost savings and carbon emissions reductions with minimal disruption operational disruption by extending the lifetime of pipeline infrastructure under a variety of UV, moisture, and temperature conditions.}

	abstract		= {Hazards in the offshore environment can imperil successful energy operations, whether those operations are conventional, renewable, or for decarbonization. The expanding accessibility of data science and the advanced applications of machine learning (ML) models creates an opportunity to assess potential hazards and the infrastructure they impact. We present a use case demonstrating the combined application of published ML tools to U.S. federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, an actively explored region for offshore energy that is affected by variable metocean conditions and geologic processes contributing to potential hazards. This paper demonstrates the streamlined use of ML tools to illuminate potential cascading risk events posed by seafloor hazards to pipeline infrastructure, as well as the hypothesized fate and transport of released material in the event of a pipeline rupture. We apply an ML-informed submarine landslide susceptibility tool (ML-LSM) which analyzes spatial features including slope and sediment type using a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to produce a susceptibility map in addition to the Climatological and Instantaneous Isolation and Attraction Model (CIIAM), an advanced Lagrangian model to predict material transport based on typical metocean conditions. These models were applied to the Gulf of Mexico to produce spatial results based on the features respective to the seafloor and metocean environments. The Advanced Infrastructure Integrity Model (AIIM) tool, which uses big data and ML models including GBDT and artificial neural networks, was applied to provide a preliminary forecast for pipeline integrity. Intersections of submarine landslide susceptibility, potential for infrastructure integrity loss, and material transport are highlighted amongst the results, which are presented spatially. The combination of these models utilized ML analytics to provide multiscale insights into potential future risks to energy infrastructure. Results of AIIM, in corroboration with various reports, show most existing pipelines are forecasted to be operating past their original design life. The ML-LSM map indicates locations with high landslide susceptibility. Comparing the ML-LSM and AIIM results, we are able identify potentially vulnerable structures that are at greater risk, or those in areas with lower landslide likelihood that may be potential candidates for lifespan extension or retrofitting to support alternative energy strategies. The results of the CIIAM model are integrated to indicate material fate-and-transport complications in the event of infrastructure rupture. Areas of potential bias and recommendations for model tuning are also discussed.}

The standard contains requirements and guidance on how to implement and apply the life cycle costing methodology, to provide decision support for selection between alternative competing options. The objective of the paper is to show recent indus-try applications and how value can be created by application of life cycle costing in oil \& gas, particularly focusing on new technology development and lower carbon energy solutions.  ISO 15663:2021 provides a framework for value optimization over the entire life of an asset. It promulgates a manage-ment methodology and application of life cycle costing across all life cycle phases. The purpose is to provide decision support for selecting between alternative options for relevant life cycle costing subject matters.  The life cycle costing applicability to new technology innovation that can replace conventional technology will specifically be addressed based on recent operator and supplier studies.  The use case concerning the deployment of subsea drones in subsea field development is presented. Subsea drone deployment is one of most challenging improvement for the oil and gas industries, being a game changer for the carbon footprint and cost reduction of operations. The ISO 15663:2021 has been applied in order to guide the decision maker throughout a proper selection of different competing options and enabling a fully representative life cycle cost analysis.  The paper also presents an example of use of life cycle costing to compare and evaluate differences in business performance, as well as opportunities, between conventional topsides and Subsea Chemical Storage and Injection System (SCSIS) for subsea wells. The methodology served as a comprehensive tool for comparing the life cycle cost of two alternative options.  Oil \& Gas Operators as well as Contractors and Vendors are the main users of ISO 15663:2021. Besides the use cases presented in this paper, the ultimate goal of the authors is to demonstrate that by using a proper life cycle costing methodology, the decision making can be ultimately rigorous and coherent.}

	abstract		= {Carbon capture and storage is seen as a key solution to engage in the global energy transition, however the operating conditions of the CO2 injection wells brings new challenges to connections for tubing string such as extreme low temperatures (-78\textdegree{}C), quick variations of temperature as well as transient phase of the CO2 that may affect connections integrity, end-finish and lubricants used. Such conditions are not limited to tubing string but also reach casing string due to radial thermal propagation in the well. This may induce low temperature on casing string and freezing of the completion fluid inducing high pressure variation: internal pressure on casing and external pressure on tubing. The current paper describes a study of the thermal gradient that may occurs for different life scenario and present test protocols which focus on CCS specificity for both casing and tubing to efficiently assess OCTG premium connections.  A numerical simulation is primarily used to understand the impact of quick drop of temperature, due to the Joule-Thomson and phase changes effects during depressurization, on the connection integrity and sealability. To correlate this simulation, the tubing connection is submitted to a dedicated test protocol relevant to CO2 injection conditions which consider high number of pressure and temperature cycling, thermal shock and sealability with thermal gradient between Pin and Box. Latest work and simulations allow us to assess the radial heat transfer and estimate the casing temperature at different depth of the well. Based on these, a specific test protocol to assess premium connection on bigger diameter, used for casing string and demonstrate their suitability for CCS wells is proposed.  Thanks to numerical simulation and research collaboration, a complementary test protocol for casing was build and allow to fully cover CCS specific load cases. Tubing and casing test protocols both allow to guarantee the integrity and sealability of premium OCTG connections with a relevant process.  The combination of numerical simulation, material study, and dedicated test protocol allow to build a complete qualification approach and support to operators when designing future CCS well.}

These mineral deposits take the form of polymetallic nodules on the seabed, cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on seamounts and ridges swept clean of sediment accumulation, and seafloor massive sulfides formed by hydrothermal systems at geologic plate spreading centers and volcanic margins. Each of these mineral deposits form on or near the deep ocean seafloor where water depths are typically 4000 m to 5500 m and on the seamounts and volcanic arcs that rise from these depths. Commercial interest in deep sea mineral deposits and the potential for collecting or mining them began in earnest in the 1970s but has been heightened in the last 20 years as the international framework for developing these minerals in International Waters has matured that has coincided with forecasted rapid rising demand for minerals to supply energy and manufacturing needs for the green economy. Compilation reports published by academia, government, and private companies are reviewed to assemble data and assess the prospects for deep sea marine minerals in the US Pacific OCS and EEZ. Key compilations were made by the Circum-Pacific Council and USGS in the 1980s and 1990s. These, together with recent (2023) efforts by USGS to compile geochemical data from USGS affiliated marine research sampling cruises from the 1980s and 1990s, historical data maintained by NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and recent publicly disclosed results from ISA contractors are used to inform the known occurrence and prospectivity for polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and seafloor massive sulfides in the US Pacific OCS and EEZ.}

	abstract		= {There is a growing desire in the offshore oil and gas industry to lower CO2 emissions from operations, especially in {FPSO}s and FLNG units. One method to lower CO2 emission is to reduce power consumption by improving the cooling system so that it utilizes colder water from deep sea. Traditionally, Sea Water Intake Risers (SWIRs), which are usually made of reinforced rubber hoses, are used to supply water from water depths up to 150m to the topside, resulting in an in-take temperature of at least 15\textdegree{}C. Nowadays, many operators have been trying to reach colder water (5-7\textdegree{}C) with target SWIR depths up to 700 m in order to support emission reduction efforts. However, there are many design and material restrictions to achieve this goal. Therefore, this paper focuses on the feasibility for steel and HDPE SWIR configurations for deep sea applications (up to 700m).  Conducting a site-specific feasibility assessment at early design stage plays an important role in selecting an optimum SWIR configuration. The main pipe of the SWIRs is generally made of reinforced rubber, steel, or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The SWIRs are installed in a free hanging configuration at the keel or on the sides of the {FPSO}. Their design can be challenging for deep water applications due to harsh environmental effects (i.e., wave and current). Interference with adjacent structures such as production risers or mooring lines can make their design even more complicated.  In order to investigate the feasibility of 350 m and 700 m SWIRs, nonlinear finite element simulations are performed using HDPE and steel pipes for a conceptual field. The steel SWIRs may provide more confidence in long term reliability as steel is a conventional material for dynamic pipelines (e.g., production risers), but can lead to weight and fabrication constraints for deep water applications. HDPE is neutrally buoyant and eliminates weight restrictions but is also prone to creep, large displacements, and connection challenges.  Today, there are many SWIRs in service, operating up to 150 m water depth and their design and operational requirements are well known by the oil and gas industry. Pumping sea water at depths greater than 150 m is a significant advancement for the industry as deeper SWIRs provide colder water and further reduction in the CO2 emission of {FPSO}'s cooling systems. This paper focuses on the challenges and design limits for deep SWIRs (350 m and 700m) made of steel or HDPE.}

	abstract		= {Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) offer unique operational and maintenance (O\&M) challenges and opportunities compared to their fixed-bottom counterparts. Situated further from shore, FOWT benefit from stronger, more consistent winds, but this increased distance leads to longer travel times and harsher conditions, reducing accessibility. Traditional jack-up vessels become impractical in deeper waters. Additionally, the inherent motions of FOWT introduce complexity to maintenance strategies.  As wind turbine dimensions continue to grow, major component replacements (MCR) require heavier lifts at greater heights. The conventional MCR approach for semi-submersible FOWT is the tow-to-port strategy, which can be complex, time-consuming, and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to explore alternative onsite options.  This article introduces a novel floating-to-floating method for FOWT MCR, developed and numerically tested using a leading software for the dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems. The component to be replaced, also referred to as ``package'' below, is typically first removed from the wind turbine nacelle, and a replacement part is then re-installed. The method comprises: A motion-compensated offshore crane capable of lifting components and adjusting winch length based on the package relative distance from its target on the nacelle.  Horizontal control lines (tag lines) connected to the package base, passing through deflectors at the nacelle top, and linked to winches or capstans.  To ensure a safe package transfer between the offshore crane and the nacelle, relative motion should not exceed a few centimeters when the package lands onto the nacelle. Numerical analysis results confirm that this method enables accurate transfers with low tension in the tag lines.  This innovative approach promises to enhance the efficiency and safety of maintenance operations for floating offshore wind turbines, addressing the unique challenges posed by their remote locations and size.}

	abstract		= {Since the beginning of pre-salt exploration, Petrobras has been using matrix acidizing to stimulate carbonate reservoirs, resulting in significant increase of productivity.  Over time, the learning curve has depicted the techniques improvement, leading to lower operation duration and costs and productivity increase. First well tests were performed without previous stimulation, revealing considerable amount of damage and, in some cases, it wasn’t even possible to flow the well without prior acidizing, both situations demanding a second test to assure evaluation objectives achievement. Considering acid job impact, it was decided to always stimulate the wells prior to well testing or production. Operation average duration continuously decreased from 15 days to hours. Treatment volumes, acid systems and chosen strategies were refined while well completion techniques have been developed.  Despite high productivities, as completion intervals got longer and higher permeability contrasts were exposed, well designers were still concerned about Recovery Factor reduction due to inefficient acid diversion. Therefore, stimulation requirements have been influencing well completion design.  Petrobras has developed a database to keep acid operation information, which made possible to get to relevant analysis presented in this paper, connecting information from different fields and well completion designs. Also, estimates of the impact of diversion in stimulation on Recovery Factor are presented along with improvement strategies, considering Pre-Salt scenario.}

	abstract		= {This article presents a case study in which subsurface evaluations regarding projects maturity and its associated risks combined with technological and schedule planning integration between three O\&G greenfield Capital Projects have enabled a significant reduction in their stage-gate activity duration, enhanced procurement strategies and mitigation of execution phase risks, thus maximizing asset value.  The adopted approach considered time spacing the three projects and an integrated governance to track projects and expedite decision-making process from concept and technology selection to authorization and execution phases, still allowing for individual project maturity and singularity to be considered. Risk mapping, evaluation and management were also structured from a unified perspective, including those related to the lifecycle of innovative technologies applied. Throughout the whole process, the standardization of documents and project management routines was also carried out.  One of the first observed results was increased agility in the stages of technical specification elaboration, revision, and independent technical assurance, leading to a 5-month reduction in Phase 3, before final investment decision gate coupled with high maturity scores.  The resulting integrated procurement strategy was also successfully executed, maximizing bid attractiveness and critical suppliers’ capacity allocation, thus allowing projects to award long lead items contracts just after final investment decision gate. Synergies between projects such as similarities and time spacing have also enabled contracts to incorporate the possibility of adopting new technologies, e.g., wells completion.  A secondary, but no less important, advantage of this integrated strategy was the reduction in the internal resources required to conduct the time-consuming process of identifying, evaluating and defining mitigation plans for the threats and opportunities of the three capital projects. One example refers to Buzios field gas management which was improved based on the synergies between projects when selecting {FPSO}s capacities and technologies.  Finally, an innovative approach to decision-making workflow, procurement strategies, and management practices, were essential to ensure the successful alignment of each capital project with corporate objectives, as well as enabling the use of new technologies based on project needs and suppliers’ capacities.}

	abstract		= {Data has always been the key: more data, at higher frequency, with better quality and, possibly, always cheaper. Data, if properly handled, means knowledge and knowledge allows better performance and with less risk. In this context, offshore IMR is not different compared to other business segments, with the addition that, in 2023, it appears to be somehow obsolete the need to mobilize a diesel propelled vessel with circa 60 people onboard with the purpose of taking some pictures and videos of subsea facilities. In order to respond to this challenge, several players in the market have launched their development programs, with the objective of developing and qualifying a new generation of subsea vehicles, or better drones, capable to match the industry needs in terms of cost efficiency and environmental footprint as well.  Focusing on pipeline inspections, AUVs are the preferred choice for long range activities while optimizing the need for support vessels in constant control of the subsea operations. However, the complexity of the subsea domain resides in the non-linear objects such as subsea XTs, manifolds, etc., i.e. all those subsea assets requiring detailed inspections at frequent interval mainly to assess the status of valves, cathodic protection, flanges and connections in general. Doing this with a standard AUV is fairly impossible, therefore a new generation of advanced AUV solutions is required, capable of DP and hovering modes, thus adding the flexibility to stop-by at given location and perform a detailed assessment of the target point, including search and localization of possible hydrocarbon leaks. This functionality implies a rethinking of the subsea vehicle which -as anticipated- is then commonly redefined by the offshore industry as ``subsea drone''.  After extensive qualification programs such subsea drones are currently being introduced by different suppliers and service providers to the market, promising substantial achievements in terms of inspection effectiveness. The focus of this paper shall then be in sharing the direct experience made by Saipem while bringing FlatFish to deepwater, in what it is believed to be a unique subsea campaign setting a number of industry firsts: autonomous deepwater inspections of flowlines, XTs, structures and risers.  Such deepwater operations, carried out offshore Brazil at the beginning of 2023, have been an essential achievement in the subsea drone development and qualification plan, unlocking the next stage of FlatFish continuous development while marking a milestone for the offshore energy industry. Saipem intends to share, from its privileged viewpoint, the main outcomes and lessons learnt from such deepwater pilot operations.}

To improve on existing workflows, BP has enhanced its previous petroleum/process engineering-focused toolkit and has globally deployed a production system digital twin end-to-end; Reservoir, Wells, Plant and Export, for model-based surveillance and optimization.  The production system digital twin is a cloud-based system that connects sensor data from each asset's data historian to an equipment data model and first principle steady state simulation tools to create a reliable status of the well network and processing facilities. This facilitates multi-disciplinary collaboration and is remotely accessible by global teams.  The integrated digital twin has three modes of operation: monitoring, simulation, and optimization. In monitoring mode, the models are automatically updated hourly with real-time data and key simulation results collected and saved. These monitoring simulations provide virtual sensor output via bespoke algorithms, revealing information that either real sensors cannot measure or are not installed to measure. Engineers utilize what-if simulation or optimization mode to test scenarios and explore capacity increase options or analyze optimization potential.  This paper will feature three practical applications to demonstrate realized values. It will describe elements of the integrated digital twin models deployed in BP's Gulf of Mexico assets, and outline the challenges and lessons in maintaining and auto-calibrating the digital twin.}

	abstract		= {Maximizing oil recovery and production remains paramount in Deepwater operations. This paper focuses on enhanced oil recovery and production optimization in the Bonga Deepwater project. Amidst the enduring challenges of sustained low oil prices in 2015, the team developed an optimized rigless intervention technology to manage the escalating cost associated with conventional rig base well intervention operations. Unlike traditional well interventions that often rely on expensive drilling rigs, the rigless approach provides a streamlined and economically viable alternative.  In the first quarter of 2017, the Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) Deepwater team undertook a groundbreaking rigless well intervention initiative in Deepwater operations. The objective was to optimize well intervention procedures and reduce operational expenditures by introducing a cost-effective rigless technological approach for Deepwater well intervention in the Bonga field. This innovative technique effectively executed tasks like electric line, slickline, and acid bullhead stimulation operations. These operations aimed to bolster production rates and curb intervention expenses while maintaining stringent process safety.  The outcome of the various well intervention campaigns was a game changer, as evidenced by the successful execution of twenty-two wells with diverse complexities and well intervention issues. These operations led to production enhancement and restoration, all achieved without process safety incidents or accidents. The implementation and subsequent adoption of this groundbreaking technology also set new records in the Deepwater environment. Notably, the deployment of the rigless technology at a water depth greater than 3281 ft emerged as an unprecedented and untested task. The technology also gave rise to other new sets of challenges. Establishing the reliability of the rigless intervention approach within the framework of the Bonga Deepwater operations posed a significant hurdle. Through detailed front-end planning, the challenges were effectively surmounted, underscoring the feasibility and potential of the rigless intervention strategy in overcoming complex well intervention operation scenarios.  This paper presents details of the successful application of the Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL) package in conjunction with a Vessel of Opportunity for a rigless campaign. In response to the evolving operational demands and challenges, particularly those involving thru-tubing intervention, the study also showcases the development and effective use of an Integrated Riser-Based Vessel (Q7000). This novel approach addressed the limitations of conventional systems and provided valuable knowledge to asset owners seeking advanced techniques for offshore well intervention operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper addresses the complexities and challenges faced in the early stages of offshore wind turbine foundation design. The focus is on understanding and managing the uncertainties inherent in Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) parameters, MetOcean data, geotechnical and geophysical characteristics, and clustering strategies. It explores the critical role of WTG parameters, including loading effects and natural frequencies, and their impact on foundation design. The paper also delves into the significance of accurate MetOcean data in determining environmental loads and examines the stages of geotechnical and geophysical assessments that provide valuable insights for concept design. A key aspect of the study is the clustering strategy, which optimizes the design process by minimizing the number of distinct foundation designs required, especially in large wind farms with diverse environmental conditions. This comprehensive approach addresses the varying levels of uncertainty in data and design parameters, offering solutions to balance accuracy with available information. The paper aims to guide practitioners in navigating the complexities of offshore wind foundation design, promoting efficient, cost-effective, and reliable solutions.}

	abstract		= {Soil-structure interaction parameters for subsea applications are not easily obtained by traditional laboratory experiments such as triaxial, oedometer and direct shear tests. A complete comprehension of topics such as displacements, reaction forces, bending moments and friction factors is commonly a result of investigations through geotechnical physical models. Although small-scale models are widely adopted due to lower costs, time spent and availability of lab facilities, full-scale modelling may achieve more realistic results, especially regarding pipe-soil interaction. Aiming to reliably reproduce the axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction behavior in Pre-Salt's typical soft marine clay profiles, southeastern Brazil, and improve knowledge, IPT (Institute for Technological Research of the State of Sao Paulo) designed and constructed, with Petrobras support, two large-scale Geotechnical testing steel tanks with complete infrastructure and a set of auxiliary systems. The lab facility was designed to meet the modeling requirements to represent the soft clays soils found on deep-waters of Santos Basin, and to operate autonomously, being divided in three main groups: (i) a soil transportation and homogenization system, (ii) a soil consolidation system and (iii) a cyclic axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction testing systems. Among the various experimental apparatus developed, the following stand out: (i) an automatic filling and emptying system, which takes water and soil into and out of the tanks; (ii) automatic servo controlled hydraulic mixers to prepare homogeneous clay slurries; (iii) a dual soil consolidation system using both vacuum preloading and surcharge loading methods, enabling the replication of predefined seabed shear strength profiles; and a (iv) fully-automated carriage capable of imposing large displacements to evaluate cyclic axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction. This paper presents aspects of the development of this novel laboratory facility and focuses on the requirements and experimental systems developed by IPT to reproduce, through physical modelling, axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction for soft clays, predominant soil type in the Pre-Salt area, southeastern Brazil. Commissioning tests, which validate the implemented systems, are presented in the end.}

	abstract		= {Deepwater wells in offshore West Africa traverse through a complicated faulted block with sand bodies ranging in 10s of meters of thickness. A horizontal or deviated configuration allows wells to intersect and produce from multiple sand formations at once. This also brings in complexity of segmentation along the wellbore with chances of either tapping into gas cap or potential gas build up in zones around the wellbore in time which could render the well uneconomical. The study provides insight into designing advanced well completions in offshore West Africa wells with Autonomous Inflow Control Devices (AICDs) under various challenging reservoir conditions that enable maximizing the producing life of the wells.  Subsurface characterization and engineering models were used to predict well performance under various conditions creating the expectation envelope of possible scenarios in pre-drilled planning phase using a digital-twin model of the well. When the wells were drilled, real time data of wellbore geometry, sand interval lengths, permeability and fluid phase saturations were estimated which were used to revalidate, revise, and optimize the design of lower completions including placement of packers and AICDs. Further, compaction well operability limits were defined using the geomechanical analysis to provide guidance on the well start-up without formation collapse. Once the wells were turned on for production, the digital twin models were recalibrated, and drawdown was readjusted for optimizing production performance.  The study presents two wells’ case studies with completely different production strategies \textendash{} one with existing gas cap and other with potential gas cap build in time. The engineering approach allowed designing lower completion in both the wells and without which the wells would otherwise be dominant gas producers in their producing life (early or later) and become inoperable with gas handling constraints at surface. Efficient design maximized oil productivity and allowed reservoir fluid influx control for efficient reservoir maintenance. Production of gas was suppressed by over 600\% and an equivalent increase in oil production was achieved with the optimized completion design.  Integrated subsurface understanding, reservoir characterization, completion engineering and execution of advanced completions in the wells maximized the oil productivity and delay the gas influx into the well. The engineering workflow designed in the study has become the framework of decision making in designing lower completions for future wells with complex zonal segmentation of reservoir or potential gas/ water influx in time.}

	abstract		= {The Subsea High-Pressure Separation, in this paper named as SHPS, is an innovative subsea separation technology designed to separate gas with high-CO2 content from the reservoir-produced fluid at the seabed. This technology operates under high-pressure conditions and utilizes centrifugal pumps to directly reinject the separated gas stream back into the reservoir. By removing the excess of gas with high CO2 content, the SHPS technology enables efficient separation and contributes to emissions intensity reduction, making it a promising system for carbon capture.  The primary objective of the SHPS is to debottleneck the topside gas processing plant and extend the oil production plateau by reducing the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) of the oil stream that reaches the {FPSO} (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading) facility. Additionally, the technology addresses challenges posed by high GOR, CO2 content, and productivity index (PI) in ultra-deep water offshore reservoirs, particularly in the Brazilian Pre-salt.  This paper provides an overview of the rigorous qualification program developed for the SHPS technology, in accordance with API 17N and 17Q standards. The technological roadmap includes successful completion of experimental tests, early engagement with subsea companies, and a de-risking phase focused on pump design and testes with dense gas as well as dynamic simulations. The remaining phases involve the construction, integration, installation, and operational testing of the SHPS system in the challenging Pre-salt environment, ultimately leading to its qualification as a transformative innovation.  Throughout the development of the SHPS, valuable insights have been gained, emphasizing the importance of a clear vision, engaged multidisciplinary project team, market validation, prototyping, testing, risk mitigation, scalability, and adaptability.  In conclusion, the SHPS technology offers significant potential for enhancing offshore oil and gas operations. By effectively separating and reinjecting high CO2 content gas into the reservoir, SHPS optimizes production, reduces emissions intensity, and contributes to environmental sustainability. Its integration with carbon capture capabilities adds further value, making it a valuable asset in the industry’s pursuit of cleaner and more sustainable energy production. The collaboration with key players and adherence to industry standards position SHPS as a game-changer in revolutionizing oil and gas production in challenging offshore environments. Overall, SHPS represents a promising solution for the industry, addressing key challenges and contributing to a low-carbon future.}

The study specifically applies to HMPE rope used to moor an {FPSO} for a duration of 7 years. The HMPE rope was in and on the seabed, connecting the mooring line to the anchor, in this application for long term mooring.  The temporary Serpentina {FPSO} moorings (2013 - 2019) included an HMPE mooring rope in each of the 9 mooring lines. All \textasciitilde{}350 ft length ropes were located at and under the mudline as forerunners to a drop-embedded anchor. The mooring lines were recovered in 2019 and stored quayside in Louisiana until being cut into samples and tested for this project. The HMPE (Dyneema\textregistered{} SK78 fiber) mooring rope underwent the following tests: Full scale MBL testsDissection \& visual / MicroCT inspectionFiber testing (comparing used fibers with new fibers, including residual creep testing (ARELIS))All results indicate that the ropes are suitable for long term use. Two full scale rope MBL tests were performed that indicated the residual rope strength was over the rated average break strength. Inspections indicated an absence of foreign particles within the rope. Fiber testing indicated a sufficient residual creep life for continued deployment in excess of the lives of most LTM systems.  No long-term deployment of HMPE fiber ropes in/on the seabed mooring a permanent facility with subsequent testing has been documented in industry to the knowledge of the authors. The results from this study indicate new potential for mooring components that are not subject to corrosion and allow for enabling anchor technologies to be used in permanent facility, offshore wind/renewables, and other mooring system applications.}

However, market limitations and challenging schedules are offensive agents to this type of architecture that need to be mitigated and overcome to add flexibility to the project and optimize resources utilization.  One of the main limiting factors of the rigid pipeline-based underwater architecture is the connection with subsea equipment. Typically, this connection is made through rigid jumpers between a Pipeline End Termination (PLET) installed at the end of the flowlines and the connection point with the subsea equipment, usually a Subsea Christmas Tree or subsea equipment, such as manifolds or boosting units. In order for these jumpers to be properly connected, it is necessary for the pipeline and equipment to be already in place and for metrology to be performed: their positions must be measured, and tolerances determined before the jumper can be manufactured and installed.  As a common practice during the interconnection phase of the rigid pipe-based subsea architecture, it is necessary to perform precommissioning steps of the rigid pipeline, including flooding and hydrostatic testing, followed by metrology between the PLET and the Subsea Christmas Tree hubs. The manufacturing process of the rigid jumper that connects the rigid pipeline to the subsea equipment, including the final welding and testing is only performed after this metrology process. This takes a certain amount of time with direct impact on the critical path for the readiness of the subsea system of the project.}

	abstract		= {The intelligent well completion in Brazilian Pre-salt wells poses challenges for workover operations. This paper describes the main challenges faced and the new methods employed for workover in this scenario. Since acid stimulation caused severe fluid losses in these wells, which are equipped with integral intelligent completion [1 \textendash{} SPE-195935], the removal of the production string brings several complications. Through tubing operations, such as the use of nippleless plug set, feedthrough packer release, and mechanical cutting of the production string, were conducted. The removal of the completion string was done in a single trip, with fluid losses sustained and well safety concerns considered. The use of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques was employed and required modifications to existing tools. A thorough planning for the new completions was developed to safely return the well to production. The successful application of these techniques in a workover operation in 2023 demonstrated its suitability for high complexity and high productivity wells, such as those found in the Brazilian Pre-salt, potentially benefiting the entire industry.}

Recently, the combination of unprecedented large data volumes, computational power, and advances in machine learning algorithms offers opportunities to expand our knowledge of the oceanic system. In this context, the main objective of this study is to accurately predict significant wave heights, combining the results from numerical simulations and data-based models. The available data at a point in the Santos Basin, Brazil, was: 5 deterministic forecast models and 80 members from probabilistic forecast simulations and in-situ wave buoy measurement. Ensemble means and neural networks forecasts were calculated and compared to Hs forecast of individual deterministic models. Root mean square error was the chosen metric to compare the deterministic models and the data-driven forecasts. The results show ensemble means (EM) outperforming individual members for lead times higher than 24h. The neural networks forecast reduced even further the errors, especially for shorter lead times.}

	abstract		= {This study seeks to investigate the influence of backflow soil and punch-through phenomena on the bearing resistance profile of the Spudcan penetration. These factors have the potential to induce abrupt failures in jack-up barges during both installation and operation phases. A recently developed finite element technique called the Press Replace Technique (PRT) is being used to study this problem. The PRT has proven to be one of the most efficient techniques for assessing the stability of a Jack-up barge under the design vertical loads during installation and operation. This method ensures a satisfactory bearing capacity, an adequate embedded depth of a Spudcan foundation, and, consequently, a stable installation of a Jack-up barge. The study shows the main criteria and the basic assumptions to be considered in the finite element analysis using the PRT, including the modelling technique of the backflow phenomenon in case the surface layer is a clay soil. The study primarily focuses on double-layer soil conditions, particularly, the condition of stiff clay over soft clay and the condition of stiff clay over loose sand conditions, where Punch-Through of a Spudcan is more likely to occur. A practical case study analyzes a scenario where the Spudcan penetrates through a thick surface layer of soft clay over a layer of sand. The findings underscore the necessity of incorporating the backflow phenomenon in the numerical analysis, particularly in relation to the occurrence of punch-through. Furthermore, when considering double-layer with a surface clay layer, the results indicate that the bearing resistance of the surface layer is predominantly influenced by the type and thickness of the soil layer underneath.}

	abstract		= {Energy transition requires the buildup of new infrastructure to produce, store, transport, transform (to e-fuels, eNH3 etc.) and utilize hydrogen through its entire value chain. The cost challenges for building new infrastructure are significant and must be built into the overall economics of the viability of hydrogen and energy transition. Alongside developing robust technology, significant work has also been done towards optimizing the new infrastructure to address cost challenges and make it at parity with existing energy solutions. However, considering the significant capital cost involved in building new infrastructure, the proposition to reusing, or repurposing existing assets to transport and store hydrogen is becoming increasingly attractive.  This paper addresses the viability of reuse and repurpose of existing infrastructure like natural gas pipelines to transport hydrogen (pure or co-transport). This paper articulates the drivers behind repurposing infrastructure like pipelines and what it would take to convert its service from natural gas to hydrogen in a safe and economically viable manner. This will include identifying the opportunities (technical, economic, and societal) and more importantly the challenges; and how best the challenges can be addressed within the prevailing economic and regulatory environments. Although much has been written about repurposing infrastructure, a concise guideline on the steps to take to repurpose is absent, since there is no straightforward answer. Repurposing must take into consideration the process, technical, human safety factors, assess the technical suitability of the asset for managing hydrogen and includes business analysis, infrastructure technical viability followed by rigorous analysis and testing. This paper attempts to develop a road map that would enable a business / operator with a protocol they can utilize to make decisions on repurposing.}

The objective of the abandonment was to safely secure the well in accordance with industry standards and local regulatory requirements. The abandonment plan and verification methods were designed to ensure full zonal isolation of formation fluids within the well and from the seabed. Hydro-mechanical perforating techniques were employed to successfully execute the objective.  To isolate potential flowable units properly, the abandonment plan was broken down into three zones. The first, or lower zone covered the open hole with cement plugs across Oligocene age sands to prevent crossflow and secure reservoir integrity. The next, or middle zone, covered the Miocene age gas sand behind 14`` casing. It included two verified barriers (primary and secondary) that were placed to ensure the isolation of the uncemented Miocene gas sands behind the 14" string. The primary barrier was established by placing 150-m (MD) of cement above the Miocene sand within a hydro-mechanically perforated interval of 14" casing and was verified to provide a rock-to-rock barrier via a bradenhead block squeeze. The secondary barrier was established via a Cut \& Pull 14'' operation and placement of a rock-to-rock cement barrier with a mechanical base. The last, or upper abandonment zone, covered shallower sands and included two independently verified 100-m barriers placed via the block squeeze method with cement plugs leveraging 200-m of explosive free, mechanical perforations.  In this paper we will share best practices and lessons learned when using a hydro mechanical perforation tool in a complex deepwater P\&A operation.}

	abstract		= {1st End PLET initiation is a common method considered for offshore pipeline installation. The 1st End PLET helps in supporting a direct permanent hold back system without any other operations by secondary, vessels. However, there are some associated factors that limit the use of 1st End PLETs. These limiting factors include the complicated design and fabrication of a hinged system, the relatively large anchor forging loads and seabed features that limit the length of chain/wire length for initiation. These factors have a direct impact on the limiting sea-states for offshore installation which may result in long weather downtime.  Subsea7 has considered novel ideas to improve the sea-state for a scenario where the wire length has been restricted for a 1st end initiation PLET with a permanent hold back system. Subsea7 has investigated the use of a stretcher wire that has the capability of straining up to 25\% at very high loads without compromising the structural integrity of the initiation wire system. The stretcher wire was connected between two chain/wire segments for a hinged 1st end PLET installation. It has also been considered for a Stab and Hinge PLET initiation method. In both scenarios, there is an improvement in the limiting sea-state compared to the case using an initiation wire/chain without the ability to stretch.  This innovative method using a stretcher wire provides a damping effect in the initiation wire system which is highly beneficial. This damping effect reduces the peak stresses and strains that typically occur at the anchor forging section of a 1st end PLET/pipe interface during initiation. Furthermore, the stretcher wire does not have any limitation to use under any external hydrodynamic pressure. Hence, this selection could be beneficial for subsea operations at any water depth.  This paper will discuss and analyze the installation methods used and the screening for a suitable stretcher wire for given 1st end PLET initiation. The limitations and drawbacks that should be accounted before considering the use of stretcher wire for initiation will also be discussed.  Subsea7 has successfully installed a number of 1st end PLETs with such a stretcher wire. Some of these projects will be listed here. Finally, this paper will also introduce potential future developments that are being considered to further improve the PLET initiation sea-state by further dampening the 1st end PLET system.}

	abstract		= {Riser pull-in is a time-consuming activity. It is required to start the Floating Unit Production (FPU) and its ramp-up. In additional, conventional systems are dedicated to install rigid riser or flexible riser in the Floating Production Storage and Offloading ({FPSO}). This article presents the challenges overcome and ongoing on developing the riser \& hull interface system for the pre-salt fields to speed up the riser connection and to provide flexibility for the riser technology a posteriori of the design system.  This work details the functionality, design, manufacturing, and pull-in activities of two different systems developed for pre-salt fields: (i) the Diverless Bellmouth with hydraulic actuators (BSDL-SI), intended for flexible riser or umbilical; (ii) and the Unified Diverless Support Tube (TSUDL), a device with the capability to support either flexible or rigid risers, with reduced dependance on shallow diving operations, allowing a broader competitivity on the riser technology solution and therefore more possibilities for the subsea layout design.  Improving a diver-assisted equipment to a diverless design significantly increases its complexity by means of enhanced mechanisms, hydraulic actuation, and monitoring systems. The authors present, for both systems BSDL-SI and TSUDL, the challenges overcome for the different project phases: design, manufacturing, and pull-in activities.  It is presented pull-in activities comparison between the developed and standard support riser \& hull interface systems to illustrate the efficiency improvement in the operations with using of those new technologies. They enable to anticipate the production and to reduce the overall project cost and greenhouses gases emissions.  Moreover, the diving assisted activity is one of the riskiest to the professional in the oil and gas industry. Therefore, by eliminating these activities it will make the project of oil and gas industry safer.  These new concepts of diverless riser supports are disruptive on the offshore industry, as they consider control \& monitoring by the FPU, although using field proven components. Considering this strategy, a new approach to the market is being used to reduce the implementation and schedule risks, such as an early engagement during the design phase with the suppliers, leading to a new concept of technology licensing and pre-qualification that will be presented on this paper.}

	abstract		= {Demand for wind energy, one of the most important renewable energy sources, will continue to expand, considering the outcome of the last COP28. A critical impediment in the use of wind turbines to harvest wind energy is its unpredictable reliability. Turbine blades are a vital and expensive part of a wind turbine. Over its service life, they can undergo degradation through exposure to environmental elements and fatigue, which can limit their effectiveness and safety. There are many failure modes that affect the performance of wind turbine systems. In particular, surface, and sub-surface damage (e.g., cracks, delamination) of the materials of construction for examples, fiberglass or carbon fiber composites often used to manufacture rotor blades are common.  It is also extremely difficult and hazardous to conduct periodic inspection, maintenance using human workforce in the offshore environment. Inspection requires personnel to be transported to the wind turbine, transferred to a rotating structure. In addition, frequently changing offshore climate with high winds in deepwater, all the while working at heights and in confined spaces, make this activity risky. Development of more evolved designs and the application of reliable and cost-effective turbine condition- monitoring techniques will help resolve this constraint.  Reducing operation and maintenance costs of wind turbine blades and other key rotating components is of paramount importance for success and global adoption. Thus, the ability to detect damage of the blades is of great significance for planning maintenance and continued operation of the wind turbine.  The current state of the art in inspection of offshore wind turbines involves personnel using drones to perform visual inspection both internally and externally. The use of drones, a great step forward, cannot however avoid having personnel on location. Further, working at heights is not something that can currently be avoided. Internal inspection of the turbine structures and working in confined spaces are also still required. The next evolution in the state of the art in inspection is to remove or significantly reduce the need for human intervention. This evolution requires several technological innovations, which include new intelligent materials that can act as sensors, enabling remote monitoring of damage to the turbine structure, both internal and external, due to stress, fatigue, environmental corrosion among other deleterious force-fields.  Strategic use of nanoparticle sensors with unique photonic or acoustic fingerprints, embedded in the engineered to order nanocomposite bulk has demonstrated to impart a degree of intelligence, permitting remote monitoring of cracks, fatigue or environmentally induced, as they are developed during operation, identifiable during periodic remote inspection. Test coupons made of a laminated nanocomposite with smart sensors layered in its bulk, are being developed, and tested to establish the concept. Salient results from testing of the composite will be provided at the end of this project, establishing pathway to scaling up and commercialization. The key impact of extending this technology to the offshore wind industry will be to enable a step-change in maintenance safety by enabling the potential to perform human-less inspection of components such as turbine rotor blades.}

	abstract		= {Inspections in the Gulf of Guinea indicated that a large number of seabed trenches appeared in front of suction anchors. The trenches had an adverse impact on the anchor capacity, which attracted wide attention from industry and academia. Currently, reliable methods need to be developed for accurately predicting the trench formation and development, for the benefit of both marine oil \& gas resources and offshore wind. This paper proposes a procedure to evaluate trenches. The motion of semi-submersible floating structures is acquired under extreme environmental conditions to obtain the trajectory of platform fairlead. Then, three-dimensional (3-D) profile is evaluated according to the fairlead motion. Finally, some measures to reduce the trench dimensions are proposed by changing the mooring systems. The results indicate that the seabed trenches are easier to form in the soft clay due to its lower shear strength. The mooring line is hard to cut into sand, thus trench is unlikely to appear in sand according to the proposed method. Besides, trench formation is also related to mooring line tension and configuration. Increasing the mooring line length can reduce the disturbing soil regions, thus inhibiting the trench formation. Other methods, e.g., changing the mooring line components, can also change the disturbed soil region. This paper presents a design procedure from the hydrodynamic calculation of floater to the trench evaluation in sand and clay, which provides some useful guidance to taut and semi-taut mooring system design for marine resource exploitations.}

	abstract		= {The field under study, situated in the Gulf of Suez, has witnessed notable success through extensive drilling operations, resulting in a substantial increase in production. However, this elevated production has brought about challenges, causing depletion in specific formations and a subsequent rise in water cuts, adversely impacting the overall field performance. Consequently, this research paper aims to identify the root cause of the heightened water cut, validate the findings, and devise a plan to mitigate the issue while enhancing recovery. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive analysis was conducted, integrating geological, petrophysical, and geomechanical aspects, alongside using sonic {3D}-Far field imaging to locate the source of water influx precisely.  The investigation into the source of water influx involved analyzing high-resolution borehole image logs to comprehend the characteristics around the wellbore. Fractures identified in the logs were scrutinized to determine their extent and openness within the formation. Acoustic, seismic, and petrophysical data were leveraged to assess fracture continuity at different depths, and the stability of these fractures was evaluated to understand their potential for fluid flow. A noise tool was employed to confirm the fractures contributing to the water influx, validating the presence of active pathways for fluid movement within the formation. Based on the comprehensive analysis, a mitigation plan was developed to address specific fractures responsible for the increased water cut. The plan aimed to minimize their impact on overall field performance, reduce the water cut, and improve recovery.  The study identified fractures, vugs, and dissolution features in different formations by analyzing image, acoustic, and petrophysical data. Acoustic measurements (Monopole, Dipole, Stoneley) provided insights into properties across domains. Stoneley analysis assessed fracture openness, while dipole anisotropy characterized lateral extent. Image and acoustic data integration distinguished open and closed fractures using a forward model approach. Acoustic reflection surveys indicated fractures extending up to 20 meters deep. Geomechanical analysis identified fractures under stress conditions. Independent validation with a noise tool confirmed extensive fractures as the primary cause of high-water influx. The collected information informed a comprehensive well-completion plan. Sonic {3D}-far-field imaging accurately identified water-producing fractures, underscoring their significance in field understanding.  This study showcases the successful implementation of an integrated evaluation approach that effectively identified a diverse fracture network. It accurately pinpointed and validated the fractures responsible for the significant water cut and developed a mitigation plan to reduce water influx and enhance recovery in the field. The primary objective of these efforts was to improve overall field recovery.}

The selected sources reviewed and characterized to provide the input to the hydrodynamic analysis are the Lebanon Thrust Fault, two fault segments of the Cyprus Arc and the Evrona and Elat faults (Dead Sea Fault system).  Tsunami event due to Lebanon Thrust Fault impacts the Nile Delta and propagates into the Suez Canal with the formation of long sub waves with a maximum water level reached at Port Said after 2 hours and a half from the beginning of propagation.  Tsunami generated by seismic events due to major fault systems belonging to the Cyprus Arc affect Port Said with a maximum water level reached at about 3 hours and a half after the seismic event.  Finally, simulations developed considering as seismic source the Evrona Dead Sea Fault, located in the Gulf of Aqaba, reveal that a significant water level increase is observed along the entire Canal at about six hours from the beginning of the tsunamigenic event.}

	abstract		= {The exploration and development of offshore renewable energy sources necessitates the handling of vast amounts of multi-disciplinary data across extensive areas. An efficient method of linking and integrating these data into a coherent ground model has become a theme of great interest. Such a ground model should assist developers in determining subsequent site investigations, optimizing field layout and foundation design, identifying geohazards and implementing suitable risk mitigation strategies. However, current practices often result in a qualitative integration, where geological formations are identified without assigning geotechnical properties to them, rendering the ground model unsuitable for site development. Moreover, the complexity of geological histories, particularly in relation to glacial and interglacial cycles and sea-level fluctuations, poses significant challenges.  Despite the scarcity of geotechnical data, efficient integration of multi-disciplinary data is essential for creating reliable ground models that capture uncertainty accurately. Geophysical data provides information on the {3D} geological and structural framework, while unit properties can be derived from in situ tests and laboratory data consistently.  Our goal is to develop a fully integrated ground model, applicable to geotechnical applications, such as the Ten Noorden van de Waddeneilanden Wind Farm Zone (TNW), located off the Dutch coast. We propose a site-specific, data-driven integrated ground model that facilitates further development of the TNW. This quantitative ground model merges all available geotechnical and geological Ground Investigation data with geophysical data into a comprehensive, consistent {3D} ground model, highlighting stratigraphic and spatial variations in ground conditions across the site.}

	abstract		= {Horizontal open holes covering long reservoir sections can be benefitted by installing inflow control devices (ICDs) along the lateral to even the production contribution from the entire heterogeneous permeability profile. During the drilling and completion process, the well can be shut in for prolonged periods of time. Though the ICDs are designed to withstand the buildup of debris, they are still subjected to the accumulation of weighting and bridging materials existing in the drilling fluid, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This debris deposits on the internal diameter of the valves or the flow control device, preventing proper shifting against the seats, or blocking the flow path of the devices. Recovering the function of the ICDs requires a chemical treatment. In high permeability formations, it is undesirable to have acid contact the rock to compromise the mechanical integrity of the formation or trigger further solids buildup in the ICD's. Therefore, an acid designed to dissolve the solid deposits on ICDs but not penetrate the formation is required.  In this study, a modified coreflood setup was designed and an acid-based chemical treatment was formulated to remove solid deposition on the ICD. The goal was to dissolve the calcium carbonate scale on the ICD with minimal penetration into the formation to avoid formation softening. The core assembly simulates the geometry of the ICD completion system with core matrix behind the ICD operating space. Calcite marble was used to represent the scale deposited on the ICDs, while Indiana limestone was used to represent the reservoir rock.  Several acid formulations were tested using the custom designed coreflood setup. One acid blend composed of a strong organic acid mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and a second blend of HCl and mutual solvent showed the desirable effect of dissolving the scale deposits (calcite marble in this case) with minimum to no penetration into the formation matrix. The success of the two acid systems in dissolving calcium carbonate deposits on the ICDs was confirmed by analyzing the pressure data during the core flooding experiment, as well as from analyzing the post-treated core samples using X-ray tomography.  Simulation of completion design in the laboratory is a key factor to test and design acid treatments to overcome scale problems in the field. Single phase acid systems containing no gelling or emulsifying agents were tested and proved capable of dissolving the solids deposited on the ICDs with minimum formation contact. This will result in an economical and easier one-step treatment in the field, avoiding the complexity encountered with pulling the whole completion string out of the wellbore to be treated with acid, then reinstall it back into the well.}

	abstract		= {Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) entails sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is injected into underground geologic sinks. Critical to the success of sequestration projects is detailed site characterization that includes reservoir assessment and evaluation of potential spill points such as intersecting faults, plugged and abandoned (P\&A'd) wells as well as leakage up the CO2 injection wellbore.  Current offshore CO2 detection and monitoring falls into two basic categories: geophysical methods and CO2 testing methods at wells sites.  Geophysical methods:are critical for the evaluation and identification of potential spill points,can image the opening of natural fractures as pressure increases during CO2 injection,can map the CO2 plume as it moves across the field.  However, geophysical methods do not answer the critical question is CO2 actually leaking? Rather, these methods highlight where CO2 may be leaking. The ability to determine if subsurface structures have adequate seal and whether those seals remain leak-proof is difficult since most offshore CO2 monitoring methods are performed at well sites. What happens when there are no wells near potential spill points? CO2 leakage could be missed.  A new approach has been developed with passive geochemical sorbers which has been used onshore for reservoir seal evaluation and CO2 monitoring for some time. This new offshore approach involves attaching passive geochemical sorbers to the bottom of Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS) nodes in deep water or using divers to place passive geochemical modules on the seabed floor in shallow transition zones. The modules are left in-place for \textasciitilde{}21 days. This provides time for the adsorption of CO2 molecules, CO2 impurities, and hydrocarbon molecules to concentrate on the geochemical sorbers.  The innovation of mobile deployment provides the ability to provide ultrasensitive detection of CO2 seepage at any potential spill point across the field. Impurities in industrial CO2 serve as a surrogate to validate that the CO2 source is subsurface and not ambient. The passive geochemical data can then be co-located with seismic data during the life of the program to provide an improved understanding and correlation between faults, natural fractures, and potential CO2 leakage.  Two case studies will be presented to illustrate the efficacy and potential of the tandem deployment mechanism. A site characterization survey in 2012 in northwestern Oman demonstrates the ability of passive geochemical sorbers to identify and map elevated hydrocarbon signatures, from a depleted gas reservoir, along fault segments, identifying current leak points that rendered the reservoir unsuitable for sequestration purposes.  A CO2 monitoring program in Algeria from 2015 \textendash{} 2021 presents a case in which {3D} seismic data indicated CO2 injection had activated a deep fracture zone several hundred meters wide, extending \textasciitilde{}150 m above the reservoir. CO2 tracers were detected at the production wells, but no CO2 tracers were detected at the surface. This indicated that the opened natural fracture did not provide a sub-seismic pathway to the surface.  The tandem technologies provide a unique capability to measure CO2 directly over potential spill points, not miles away. Furthermore, once CO2 injection has begun, and changes occur in the subsurface, the mobile deployment of the modules allows for movement and redeployment of seismic and geochemical sensors directly over areas of concern.  Additionally, passive geochemical sensors can be placed around P\&A'd wells as well as around the injection well to evaluate potential leakage due to improper plugging or cement deterioration. The paper will close with a summary of the lessons learned in performing real-world studies over the last 12 years.}

	abstract		= {Subsea production field development is an evolving process. This paper describes subsea power and communications distribution network solutions that are designed for life of field and can be configured to meet the evolving needs of a production field. It also highlights the capabilities and limitations of such solutions to facilitate its application with the goal of minimizing capital expense and maximizing performance and reliability.  Leveraging the design and flexible configurability of deployed product, a novel design has been established to make the product suitable for brownfield applications. The product design has been reviewed and matured from three key aspects \textendash{} signal analysis, hardware prototyping and communications testing. For analysis, models have been developed in tool (ORCAD) to determine the performance capability of the novel design. Hardware prototyping and API 17F Q1/Q2 tests establishes the reliability benchmark. Lab based communication bench tests provides insights on data transfer and integrity such that boundary conditions are established. Holistic requirements-based testing, based on experience of deployed product, is key to successful launching of novel design.  Early analysis revealed areas to improve the design margin when applied in novel design. Analysis also highlighted areas that can be further utilized beyond current capability of the product. Hardware prototype is built to determine the packaging in subsea modules and functional performance. Functional performance is determined using API Q1 tests and Q2 tests are executed to understand the design margin when physical stress(es) is applied. Lab based bench tests revealed communication performance and established data related specifications for the novel design. Assimilating the results has allowed the boundary conditions to be established for which the product is deemed suitable in multiple applications. Successful implementation of the product allows it to be applied in greenfield and brownfield opportunities. Novel design implementation enabled leveraging existing equipment and not require significant investments on new umbilicals in extending or tied back of production fields. It also shall allow phased introduction of well by leveraging the switching feature (controlled from Topside) in the module.  The paper discusses flexibility aspect (multiple configurations) of the product and touches upon how it is leveraged for brownfield application with a novel design. Using same building blocks of an existing product in multiple applications allows to accelerate reliability growth and benefit the industry.}

	abstract		= {Perforating multiple zones in a single deep-water well, where the zonal pressures between reservoirs differ significantly, at times in excess of 2000 psi, presents substantial challenges in developing and maintaining sufficient dynamic underbalance for effective perforation cleanout across the zones. The principal objective of this study is the development of recommended design practices for perforating deep-water, extended reach, step-out wells that present such challenges.  Design practices were evaluated through the perforation strategy optimization of four multi-zone, deep-water wells situated in the Jubilee Field, off the coast of Ghana. The sensitivity of dynamic underbalance generation and perforation cleanout performance to changes in readily modifiable gun system characteristics was studied. This includes charge loading, string positioning and management of gun free volume. Multi-physics simulation was used to resolve the fluid and structural dynamic responses of the system during perforation. The applied methodology provides enhanced visualization and resolution of the system-wide dynamics during this highly energetic event. It accounts for the complexity of the material interactions and the resulting 3-dimensional loading on the string from charge detonation, casing fragmentation and high-speed fluid flows [Glenn, 2014]. To build confidence in this analytical approach, pressure data recorded downhole was used to close the loop on the process and calibrate the simulations against their respective job histories.}

In this laboratory study, we investigate the response of a dry Navajo sandstone specimen to constant-rate water injections under vertical loading up to 12 MPa and zero lateral strain conditions. Our measurements and analyses include identifying the heterogeneity features in the internal structure of the rock via X-ray imaging, the geochemical composition of rock minerals via XRD and XRF, the evolution of the axial load and deformations, and fluid pressure upon injection, and the full-field planar deformations on the rock surface through digital image correlation. The initial goal was to understand the fluid flow regimes ranging from diffusive flow to localization of fractures induced by water injection; however, the high permeability of the sandstone would require higher injection rates than the range available in the current pumping system. The results enhance our understanding of fluid flow and damage mechanisms in the near wellbore region, utilizing a multi-phase, multi-scale, and multi-sensor monitoring system to overcome the limitations of traditional single-sensor measurements.}

	abstract		= {Cementing operations consists of placing cement slurries between casing-casing and casing-formation to achieve multiple objectives including zonal isolation, corrosion resistance, isolation of water bearing formations, etc. Cement slurries are tailored in the laboratory environment simulating downhole conditions to achieve the required placement times (i.e. thickening time) for the slurry to remain in a liquid state during pumping. This study presents an artificial intelligence model developed to predict the cement slurries thickening time based on historical experimental data, along with the ability of the model to continue learning based on the flow of output results.  Collected data sets of different input parameters were gathered and studied to estimate cement thickening time. Based on statistical analysis, only five inputs (Pressure (psi), measured depth (ft),bottom hole circulating temperature (\textdegree{}F), retarder additive concentration (\%), and slurry density (ppg)) had a positive impact on the correlation coefficients between the inputs and target properties. A model was developed using Python programming language to predict the thickening time. The data was fed into the model to train and test the input factors impacting the target property using a neural network method.  The model expressed an integrated relationship between the training and validation data which resulted in an optimum learning performance revealed by a loss function plot. As a result, the scatter plot for prediction vs actual has illustrated the prediction of the thickening time with an average accuracy of 83\% confirmed by the model box plot. The model validation consisted of employing a set of data to predict the thickening time for more than 11 slurries with an average absolute error of 6\%.  Model implementation indicated that over 200 hours per month were saved due to reduced number of thickening time test iterations required to be run before executing the job which positively impacting operational efficiencies associated with cost, resource allocation, and investigation assessment. The outcome results from this model and the process used herein could be scaled up to consider other properties, i.e. ultra-sonic cement analyzer UCA, fluid loss, free fluid, etc.}

	abstract		= {Today many exploration, appraisal, and development well test operations are performed in new frontiers, remote locations, deepwater offshore environments, and complex gas-bearing reservoirs. Deepwater welltest and well cleanup operations are presenting unique challenges related to flow assurance aspects that are beyond the standard welltest playbook. Several failures and operational issues related to flow assurance such as the plugging of pipelines and/or tubing by wax or hydrates have hindered the interpretability of data, compromised well test objectives, significantly increased the total costs, or led to serious health safety and environmental (HSE) incidents. Several past experiences have shown that it is nearly impossible to perform a proper deepwater well test with achieving well test objectives without an appropriate test design, equipment selection and operations planning. The assessment and mitigation actions to reduce the risk of hydrate formation are of paramount importance in such welltest design activities.  Hydrate formation is one of the most common flow assurance issues during the well test and well cleanup operations in gas and gas-condensate reservoirs, particularly in deep-water offshore environments. Low water column temperature in deep water along the marine riser can cool down the produced fluids considerably. This in turn can trigger hydrate formation introducing significant challenges to the operations while increasing the risk of HSE incidents and therefore compromising the welltest objectives.  Well tests and well clean-ups are complex operations performed offshore today that involve multiple expertise across different domains and services including temporary surface well test package, landing string, and drill stem test (DST) string with specialized downhole tools and components or permanent completion. Therefore, the risk assessment of hydrate formation and plan of mitigation actions must be performed in line with the detailed welltest operation sequences and technical capabilities of the equipment used offshore. Today there are no definitive practical workflows available that would guide operators through the process of planning deepwater well test operations effectively with a detailed assessment of the risk of hydrate formation and mitigation plan.  During the course of past three years, over twenty-five gas well tests were successfully completed in deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments around the globe. This success is mainly driven by the application of hydrate studies performed with new-generation transient multiphase wellbore flow simulation software. Hydrate studies coupled with fine-scale reservoir models for well test design, enable the evaluation of hydrate formation risks and help operators develop mitigation actions. The selection of an appropriate hydrate inhibitor and optimization of the chemical injection system is essential to achieve the required chemical injection capabilities to prevent hydrate formation. Despite all the mitigation actions against hydrate formation, our experience has shown that rigorous monitoring and quick reaction to early detection of hydrate formation was instrumental in preventing several substantial problems. This paper describes an innovative approach and provides practical recommendations that can be used to assess the risk of hydrate formation and develop mitigation actions during the design stage of well tests. Besides, this paper highlights the results and lessons learned from the multiple welltest operations performed in recent years.}

The approach was through modeling, simulation, manufacturing, testing and piloting of tools for underwater intervention operations. Pilot production demonstrated the viability of the technology at its current maturity. The combined use of different strategies for using technology will allow gains in all aspects evaluated: Reduction in lead-time for emergency purchases of up to 200 days, average in cases where the original manufacturer of the part does not have it available for immediate delivery; Reduction of up to 12\% in the evaluated spare parts stock, with annual economic gains that can reach up to 2.5\% of the amount stored; This is an additional alternative for obtaining parts that are difficult to acquire (for example, obsolete). The novelty is the use of Additive Manufacturing to manufacture custom-made parts with a better weight/mechanical resistance ratio. Other advantages of this approach can be mentioned, such as reduced lead time and inventory, with a virtual database, functioning as a repository whenever necessary, with demonstrated gains, in a pilot, for special underwater intervention operations, especially in prototype tools for ROVs to operate in shallow waters. Using this strategy can enable complex subsea operations in the oil and gas industry.}

The first initiative is the development of a new seismic sensor that can remain on the seafloor for up to five years, the On Demand Ocean Bottom Node - OD OBN (Lopez et al., 2023), helping to decrease the cost of seismic monitoring surveys. The second initiative is a new type of seismic source with lower environmental impact, the Marine Vibrator, which improves the usage of the available energy of the seismic source within the most useful frequency band for seismic acquisition, suppressing higher frequencies potentially harmful for marine mammals (Wartzok and Ketten, 1999). The third initiative is a pilot {3D} seismic acquisition in deep-offshore Brazil using fiber optic cables, originally installed on the seafloor as part of a Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) system, which will be interrogated using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) while recording shots from a seismic streamer vessel present in the area. It is expected that the {3D} seismic data acquired in this manner will offer a good understanding of the potential for DAS application for seismic data acquisition using fibers laid on the seafloor, considering the fiber's limitations in sensitivity and angular response. In addition to conventional applications for reservoir monitoring, these technologies are promising for applications linked to the energy transition, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, where the expected low commercial value of the sequestered CO2 requires low-cost monitoring methods to be affordable.}

The focus of this paper will be on a flexible input, multi-Kilowatt hour seabed battery system which builds on multiple recent and resident AUV demonstration projects, featuring battery and renewable energy powered docking stations with temporary and permanent underwater residency of AUVs for carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring and hydrocarbon leak detection.  The benefits of the system will be explored including enabling long term deployment of monitoring and surveillance equipment, AUV residency for inspection regimes and providing the interface from subsea equipment to surface communications.  The infield charging and communications station system will therefore allow AUVs to dock, recharge the AUV batteries, upload mission data and receive new mission parameters without requiring manual offshore intervention, with less reliance on carbon-intensive traditional vessels and less susceptibility to adverse surface weather conditions.}

	abstract		= {Sediment plumes are a key issue in assessing the environmental impact of seabed mining. The Metals Company carried out a pilot Nodule Collector test in the NORI-D license area in late 2022. The equipment test was closely monitored in the nearfield from the Allseas test mining vessel and in the far field from a dedicated monitoring vessel. The monitoring program was designed to quantify the concentration of sediment returned to the sea at a mid-water discharge point, as well as the sediment disturbed by the Prototype Collector Vehicle at the seabed. The monitoring efforts were aimed at providing baseline data as well as observing the concentration, movement and settling of the plume. All monitoring efforts were supported by numerical modelling, which was used to inform the best monitoring locations as well as the conditions expected during the testing of the collector vehicle.  Following a comprehensive planning phase, decisions on monitoring methods and equipment and their deployment were described in detailed SOPs for all field work to ensure consistency of all measurements. This included details of instrument configurations and deployment strategies for fixed and mobile monitoring platforms. However, complex field operations are almost impossible to plan down to the minute and a degree of flexibility is required to ensure optimal use of the campaign. The realized monitoring strategy reflected the basic guiding principles detailed in the SOPs adapted to logistical circumstances encountered in the field, This is particularly important to allow comparisons between different types of analyses, including the interpretation of analyses of individual water samples.  In this paper we will present the monitoring strategy and plan developed by DHI in collaboration with The Metals Company. We will also present the different components of the monitoring (mobile assets such as AUV/ROV), fixed stations (mooring lines and landers), water and sediment sampling that were used during the campaign. Recent experiences of tracking and observing plumes with acoustic instrumentation mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROV), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), static seabed landers, and oceanographic moorings will be presented.  Specifically, this presentation will discuss:The value of predictive modelling prior to the start of trials, with the objective of monitoring where significant plume was to be expectedHow differences between predictive modelling and real-time observations influenced short-term monitoring strategiesKey challenges related to instrument performance at extreme depths, mobile monitoring platforms, and simultaneous monitoring operations}

This paper describes how Moana Minerals chose to approach conducting exploration activities, one of the greatest challenges to Deep Sea Mining (DSM) development and the securing of the social license to advance to eventual mining of the resources, in an unconventional manner.  The remote location of the project poses logistical challenges in mobilizing to and operating in the region and is a significant cost driver. Historically, exploration campaigns mobilized large vessels from mainland Europe, the Americas, and Asia as this model works well when contemplating long duration and widely temporally spaced campaigns without the need to revisit. Moana Minerals, when considering these challenges determined a multi-year deep sea mining (DSM) exploration program conducted in such a remote location can be better optimized by the deployment of a smaller yet highly capable ``exploration optimized'' vessel that is dedicated to the task and is based full time in the Cook Islands.}

The methodology presented in this study encompasses: Definition of a target to a greenfield development; A comprehensive processes review with information flows mapping, critical paths of activities, interdependencies, and main schedule offenders identified from pre-discovery to first oil production; Structuring a set of solutions, initiatives, and levers for time gains in an integrated manner among all stakeholders, including paradigm shifts and change management applied to the company portfolio; and a program management office. The achieved results were a set of approximately 70 initiatives with assumptions, new processes, and strategies considering technical and business disciplines to be applied in production development projects from discovery to first oil. This comprehensive process review concludes that there are alternatives for reductions in greenfield project schedules that could potentially reduce about 30\% of the time to first oil when the assumptions of the solutions are met, and the optimistic scenario is revealed in the discovery and appraisal. However, we highlight the necessity of risk and return evaluation for each solution, as well as the need for changing the company's standards, norms, and organizational culture.}

	abstract		= {Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has been recognized as a tool to aid the decarbonisation of carbon heavy industries, with the storage of CO2 in the subsurface over geological timescales being a key component in the CCUS process chain. Assessing and managing the risks involved in subsurface storage of CO2 is required so decisions can be made about the design, operation, monitoring and acceptability of potential projects. As with existing industrial activities, a number of approaches exist for assessing risk ranging from purely qualitative approaches through to quantitative approaches.  A structured, proportional risk assessment approach is proposed, aimed at identifying, analysing and evaluating the risk from a candidate subsurface store through a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to gain the most benefit. Development of a register of subsurface containment risks allows for the identification of scenarios of concern, which can be coupled with risk matrices to provide an estimation of the risk level together with its acceptability. More in depth qualitative techniques such as bowtie analysis encourage different disciplines to collaborate and enhance communication, both internally and externally, of the controls present for the most significant risks. The combination of bowties with a quantified, event tree-based model can allow for numerical determination of leakage probability and magnitude. Quantitative methods can therefore estimate insurance liabilities and allow comparison of options or with acceptance criteria. However, these assessments are underpinned by the quality of inputs. Given that the CCUS industry is still in its infancy, data surrounding event likelihoods and leak magnitudes, especially for geological leakage pathways, can have large amounts of associated uncertainty; this uncertainty must be taken into account when evaluated the overall acceptability of projects. Whilst both quantitative and qualitative methodologies for risk assessing subsurface CO2 storage have their advantages and disadvantages, it is when combined as part of a structured CCUS risk assessment approach that the most benefit is gained.}

	abstract		= {Blending hydrogen with natural gas (H2-NG) in pipelines is one of the pragmatic solutions to lower carbon emissions from natural gas usage. This strategy entails incorporating a defined percentage of H2 into established NG networks. This work evaluates the potential of H2-NG blending in the Telfer Gas Pipeline (TGP) \textendash{} a part of the Western Australia transmission network. The effect of increasing H2 fraction on pressure profile, corrosion, and erosion along TGP was addressed.  The pipeline model was developed and validated using PIPESIM-Net software. The tested gas mixtures were calibrated with comparable studies, while the pipeline model was validated with the real operating conditions of TGP. Then, a thorough sensitivity analysis was performed, investigating the impact of varying H2 concentrations. The molar fraction of H2 in the gas mixture increased from 0\% to 80\%, with a 10\% step.  The inclusion of H2 substantially increased the pressure profile at both the TGP's mainline and delivery nodes (sinks). This rise in pressure resulted from notable reductions in both density and viscosity as the H2 fraction increased, contributing to decreased hydrostatic and frictional pressure losses along the pipeline, respectively. Thermodynamically, the compressibility factor reached unity when the gas composition contained 80\% H2. The heightened pressure in the pipeline caused increased corrosion rates, although the erosional velocity ratio exhibited a slight decrease with higher H2 content.  This analysis offers critical insights into the impact of H2 concentration on the system, providing a comprehensive assessment of potential risks and opportunities of H2-NG blending in transmission networks.}

	abstract		= {TotalEnergies is committed to the goal of sustainability as it targets to achieve NetZero by 2050. One of the levers to carbon intensity reduction is to reduce direct emission from our portfolio and developing carbon sinks. Hence, the plan is to provide carbon storage services which would store equivalent of 50-100Mt/year of CO2 (TotalEnergies, 2023). To realize this objective, the logical step is by building capacity, in terms of skills and projects, to adapt to the new requirements of CO2 injection.  This ambition requires developing viable and sustainable surface and downhole equipment design which can meet the challenges of CO2 injection. Our focus is the case of CO2 that is transported in dense phase to the well and then injected into a highly depleted reservoir. Among the challenges associated with the dense phase CO2 injection into a depleted reservoir is the question of compatible completion strings, tubing connections and Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV); which form the primary well barrier, capable of handling potentially extreme low temperatures and rapid swings of temperatures associated with transient conditions of CO2.  Thus far, we have proposed credible load cases for completions stress analysis and developed a methodology / guideline for completions design in highly depleted reservoir. Today, we routinely apply it to every project in focus; to incorporate CO2 sequestration in the project development plans.  The results of this methodology clarify the specific need(s) for completions design and associated equipment qualifications for CCS applications in highly depleted reservoir environment.}

	abstract		= {Detailed geotechnical soil investigation surveys have been performed with onshore laboratory testing and interpretation to support the development of two wind farm sites, herein denoted Sites 1 and 2, in the Baltic Sea, offshore Poland. The two wind farms are planned to have about 50 wind turbines each with a total combined capacity of about 1.4 GW. Large diameter monopiles have been selected as the foundation concept with a target embedment length ranging from 25 m to 40 m.  The presence of an overconsolidated, high to ultra-high strength subglacial till layer, located at a depth of about 20 m to 40 m below seabed, is critical for the monopile foundation design. This layer presents significant challenges in terms of pile drivability, while also providing support to the monopile foundation design, both for the foundation capacity as well as the overall structural stability and integrity. The onshore laboratory testing included classification testing, static and cyclic strength testing, and testing to determine in-situ stress history and deformation properties. The interpretation included the integration of the geophysical data, geological, in-situ testing, and geotechnical laboratory testing to derive representative soil parameters for the subglacial till. X-ray scans showed signs of a complex geological process having taken place.  The subglacial till is heterogeneous, with sandy, gravelly clay alternating with homogenized deformed clay layers. It exhibits poor sorting, including intermittent sand layers and erosive contacts at various depths. Seismic reflections display varying amplitudes and facies characteristics, reflecting its intricate geological history linked to the last glaciation event. The presence of inclined layers, deformed laminations, and fractures help to confirm glaciotectonic origins. Key parameters for strength assessment are presented. The cyclic strength properties are compared to experience from literature offering insights into its cyclic loading behavior. The thorough investigation provides essential insights into the geotechnical properties of subglacial till at the two offshore wind farm sites, crucial for designing reliable monopile foundations in challenging marine environments.}

This concept design is based on the metocean data in Morro Bay Area, California (CA). The 1100-meter water depth and swell metocean (long period wave) give rise to extra technical challenges for floating OSS design, especially for the dynamic cable design.  The developed semi-submersible Floating Offshore Substation (FOSS) solution (810MW, HVAC) has been further validated and confirmed by one wave basin test performed at Oceanide (South-France) during July 2023.  As one part of one complete FOSS solution, how to transport and install (T\&I) FOSS at California west coast site has been investigated. This California site condition brings special challenges for the T\&I, such as the port infrastructure limitation, etc.  The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the recommended transportation and installation (T\&I) methodology for the FOSS, which includes the load-out, dry transport, discharge, mooring preset, wet tow, mooring hookup and dynamic cable installation.  The recommended T\&I methodology is mainly based on the fabrication base case, that the FOSS topside has been integrated onto the hull at the fabrication yard.  Based on the recommended T\&I methodology presented in this paper, it can be concluded that the GE FOSS (810MW, HVAC) can be transported from Asian fabrication yard to California west coast, and installed.}

	abstract		= {Amid the global energy expansion, where diverse energy sources are needed to meet rising demand, minerals like nickel, cobalt, and lithium become imperative for the renewable energy supply chain. While these minerals are almost exclusively mined from land, when utilizing offshore industry expertise, these critical minerals become accessible by deep sea minerals harvesting of the seabed, where vast reserves of such minerals remain untapped. This paper highlights a test of the feasibility of side-by-side mooring for offloading such minerals in the offshore environment. The study employs frequency and time domain simulations to evaluate the operation of a two-vessel system. The setup involves a production vessel with dynamic positioning (DP) and a transport vessel moored side-by-side, connected with mooring lines and fenders. Simulations span various wave heights, periods, and directions. Critical metrics like line tensions, fender loads, and vessel motions are then contrasted against predefined criteria, pinpointing scenarios where the operation could be viable.  The simulations revealed that the primary determinant of operability is line tensions. Factors such as the direction of incident waves, wave period, and the shielding effects from the DP vessel also significantly influence outcomes. Particular care should be taken to manage the drafts of the vessels to prevent thruster impact on the transport vessel, which would elevate line loads. The DP settings of the production vessel should also be tuned to account for the vessel moored alongside.  Additionally, the paper discussed further work needed to establish guidance on the approach and departure of the transport vessel. The maneuvering characteristics of the transport vessel will be pivotal during its approach and departure, especially given the operations' remote open water location and unpredictable tug support availability as a result thereof.}

In the United States (U.S.), the primary document upon which approval to construct an offshore wind project is based is the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), submitted by the offshore wind developer. The COP forms the foundation of content in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). BOEM's approval of the EIS is the key decision milestone, enabling the issuance of nearly all federal permits needed to construct and operate an offshore wind farm within Federal Waters of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). More than 30 specific expert-led assessments and studies are included in a COP, requiring a minimum of two years of effort. Typically, the developer engages a consultant to coordinate and author the development of the COP, with support from specialist subcontractors. In parallel, the developer either hires, or has an internal department concurrently working on, the design and early phase engineering of the project. A natural organizational tendency is for these teams to operate within their technical areas, communicating with each other only at specific interfaces on specific topics. This common tendency can result in engineering decisions with unanticipated effects on the COP development and permitting schedule.}

Here, we adapt and apply a promising framework \textendash{} originally proposed by the present authors for the prediction of wave conditions on the European North West Shelf \textendash{} to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The approach consists of using an attention-based long short-term memory recurrent neural network to learn the temporal patterns from a network of available buoy observations, that is then combined with a random forest based spatial nowcasting model, trained on reanalysis data, to develop a complete framework for spatiotemporal prediction for the basin. By way of demonstration, the new method is applied for the short-range prediction of wave conditions up to 12 hours ahead, using in-situ wave observations from the sparse network of National Data Buoy Center locations as an input, with the corresponding spatial mapping learned from the physics-based Met Office WAVEWATCH III global wave hindcast. The full spatiotemporal forecast system is assessed using independent measurements in the vicinity of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, previously unseen by the machine learning model. Results show that accurate real-time, rapidly updating wave predictions are possible, available at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional physics-based methods. The success of the approach, combined with the flexibility of the framework, further suggest its utility in related metocean challenges. While still at an early stage of development into a fully relocatable capability, it is intended that this contribution provides a foundation to stimulate a series of subsequent efforts to help support improved offshore planning and workability \textendash{} including (but not limited to) applications linked with better resolving spatial variability across renewable energy sites, predicting ocean current regimes in the proximity of oil \& gas platforms, as well as informing adaptive sampling strategies conducted by autonomous vessels \textendash{} where the adoption of such a machine learning approach, that can be run on a laptop computer, having the potential to revolutionize data-driven decision-making by the industry.}

	abstract		= {On top of the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean lie trillions of polymetallic nodules that contain many of the metals needed for transitioning to a low carbon future. In 2021, the pre-protype seafloor nodule collector ‘Patania II’ performed successful in-situ trials at 4,500 m (>14,750 ft) water depth. The trials entailed collecting nodules using a hydraulic collector head and were complemented by an extensive environmental monitoring program. The gathered results will feed directly into a Seafloor Nodule Collector (SNC) and collector head design iteration study aimed at further improving performance. This paper presents the initial results of the Seafloor Nodule Collector improvement study using Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}). The scope of the study is twofold, firstly the collector head design is improved and secondly, the wake behind the SNC is minimized. The combination of field experience and data with high-fidelity {CFD} simulation technology will result in a reliable impact prediction of the design improvements to be done. This paper will provide a useful methodology and reference for further design improvements for seafloor nodule collector vehicles, not only to enhance the hydraulic performance but also to reduce the environmental impact of deep-sea mining operations. Key performance indicators are being identified that contribute to sediment plume dispersion.  First, with respect to the collector head, the collector performance is influenced by its geometry, the jet- and surrounding water inflow and forward speed. The combination of these factors will create a pressure profile on the seafloor, which allows nodule pick-up and hydraulic transport. The trials showed that the balance between performance, robustness and unwanted water/sediment intake is impossible to determine in lab conditions. The in-situ gathered performance data, like pick-up efficiencies related to jet velocities, was used to validate {CFD} simulations and establish a reliable collector head numerical model. Based on measurement data and {CFD} results, a seafloor pressure profile base-case has been defined. A step-by-step approach was followed by simulating several modifications to the collector head geometry, by varying the jet flow and by applying recirculation of the discharge water to the suction head. This was carried out while consistently maintaining the base-case pressure profile as a reference. The modified numerical model shows that it is feasible to re-circulate and re-use a significant amount of sediment-laden jet water, while maintaining the pick-up performance and reliability. The set-up allows controllability on the amount of re-circulation. The obtained re-circulation results in a significant increase of sediment density, in combination with a decrease of diffuser outlet flow. This will improve the diffuser discharge characteristics and further reduce the sediment plume and associated environmental impact.  Secondly, a {CFD} study for wake modelling has been performed on Patania II as a base case. An optimization study was performed, which involved improving the SNC geometry and diffuser location with the aim to reduce the turbulence behind the vehicle and consequently reduce local sediment dispersion and related environmental impact.}

	abstract		= {Gas field developments with long tiebacks into existing infrastructure poses flow assurance challenges due to the liquid drop out causing high back pressure and high energy consumption to transport the production leading to high OPEX, CAPEX, and CO2e emissions. A novel Pseudo-Dry-Gas (PDG) concept was developed as an inline gas-liquid separator which separate liquids from the gas and flows into a separate liquid line, along with new approaches to flow assurance design, to induce hydraulically ‘dry gas’ behavior within a wet gas pipeline over the operating envelope. The work aims to demonstrate the techno-economic benefits from a feasibility study focusing on the flow assurance aspects. Comparisons are made for project economics and integrated life cycle CO2 assessment showing the ``energy intensity" for PDG and the previous chosen industry-norm concept.  A widely accepted industry design software is used to generate data for two concepts based on a mid-water (100-200m) gas and oil field development with a 50 km tieback into an existing platform. Advanced flow assurance design technique is developed to evaluate the optimum location for PDG unit along the pipeline for effective subsea separation coupled with mitigation of flow assurance concerns, primarily hydrates. The performance of the PDG unit was predicted by linking the field data with PDG test data. The test was conducted on a 6" flow loop with 6'' PDG prototype with pilot scale unit, covering the operational pressure and temperature and anticipated fluid properties. The CO2 assessment was undertaken in accordance with ISO 14044, linking the reservoir production to the power demand to support production, which was then converted into the equivalent CO2e emission.  The results showed that the PDG design removed the need for a new unmanned processing platform over the main field and a new MEG (mono ethylene glycol) regeneration system at an existing platform which also serves as the host tie-in point. The removal of a large jacket with associated topside process equipment and brownfield platform modifications delivers reductions in CAPEX and better economic indicators, NPV (net present value) and IRR (internal rate of return). This beneficial economic outcome is reinforced with a reduction in carbon intensity for PDG concept, with more than 40\%, compared to the chosen industry-norm concept. These observations are the net result of changing the internal flow resistance curve of the gas tieback from a quadratic function to a linear function enabling more efficient use of downhole pressure and temperature to reduce the overall carbon intensity of upstream gas production and mitigate flow assurance risks for hydrates and liquid surges.  The work will benefit practicing engineers through the evaluation of novel PDG technology concepts for mixed oil and gas tiebacks, currently in pre-production testing phase, to improve the field economic and to evaluate CO2e emissions over the life cycle of a project in accordance with ISO 14044.}

Since 2014, Eni Petroleum have successfully conducted plug back, sidetrack, and recompletion of three wells at the Devil's Tower spar platform in offshore Gulf of Mexico. The platform has eight TTRs with subsea wellheads, which were subsequently tied back to the spar and completed in surface wellheads with dry trees.  This paper presents the riser system design, challenges and the results from the pre-drill dynamic riser analysis and post-drill riser monitoring assessment due to environmental, vessel, and operational loads. This paper also addresses the key benefits and challenges involving the use of a temporary wear liner through the existing spar top tensioned riser system while working within the available aircan tension capacity and dimensional clearance through the riser pipe.  Dynamic global riser analysis is conducted to ensure that there is adequate strength capacity with the wear liner in place. Furthermore, the riser system should tolerate loss of buoyancy through a flooded compartment in the aircan and a shut-in scenario where the drill string is supported by the surface BOP. Results from wear and fatigue damage due to vortex induced vibrations (VIV), vessel induced motion (VIM), drilling induced vibrations (DIV) and wave induced motions are presented based on design motions and monitoring data.}

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning have been the subject of intense media hype and therefore it was deemed appropriate to develop a deep-learning algorithm (DLA) to predict VS and compare its performance with conventional empirical methods of determining VS. A database of 11 sites in the Bay of Campeche with in situ measurements of VS using P-S logging and 8 clay soil parameters, including in situ measurements of net cone resistance (qnet), water content (w), submerged unit weight (g’), void ratio (eo), undrained shear strength (su), effective overburden pressure ($\sigma{}${'}vo), over consolidation ratio (OCR), and plasticity index (Ip), was used to train a DLA and develop empirical equations based on multiple regression analysis (MRA) to predict VS. The accuracy of the results (i.e., how close the predicted VS values are to the in situ measured VS values) illustrates the great potential DLA has to become another class of computational tool to predict VS, and DLA has the advantage that it can be continuously updated as new data become available. The DLA was found to outperform MRA when the three input variables are measurements of qnet, w, and $\sigma{}${'}vo and when the eight clay soil parameters are used as input parameters. The results suggest deep learning has the potential to overcome prediction limitations associated with linear or polynomial trends and adjust to discrete variabilities in soil conditions. They also reveal potential applications for deep learning in reducing uncertainty in the characterization of areas with complex soils without drastically increasing the scope of a site investigation.}

	abstract		= {In offshore construction, geotechnical risk assessment of pile installation during the preparatory phase is of major importance. Pile driveability analyses are part of these preparations and provide, primarily, insights into the relation between hammer blow count, driving stresses, and the static soil resistance during driving (SRD). In case the total weight of the ``pile driving system" (i.e. the combination of pile, follower and hammer) exceeds the SRD, a phenomenon referred to as "pile run" or "drop fall'' might occur. Usually, at this point in wave equation analysis software, no hammer blow count is calculated until a depth is found where the SRD increases sufficiently to support the weight of the pile driving system again. For many (offshore) projects, with ever increasing weight of piles and hammers, the consequences of pile run to equipment and foundations could be significant. Moreover, once offshore, options for mitigation are limited or are met with high costs and/or significant delays. This paper elaborates on a model that was developed to predict the extent of pile run and velocity of pile and hammer during a drop fall. The model includes an approach that allows for assessment of effects from liquefaction during high velocity pile runs. A correction for strain rate dependent shear strength is also included. The model was validated by means of field observations of multiple controlled pile run events during construction of an offshore wind farm. More recently, pile run field observations from a monopile installation project became available to the authors, for which the model also proved satisfactory. The observed and analyzed pile run for this specific case is also reported. Use of the model provides insight into the extent of pile run and could provide a basis for assessment of mitigating measures. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine which model parameters are key and what uncertainty bandwidth in pile run predictions should be taken into account.}

One of the key storage differences between liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen is the key advantage that liquid hydrogen has a higher density than compressed hydrogen in storage. Relative to compressed hydrogen, more compact containment could be used. At the marine loading facility, means of recovering or reliquefying the hydrogen boil-off gas could be present, accommodating one of the significant downsides of transportation of hydrogen as liquid.  Static storage has its set of issues, but transportation can be more demanding. Long range marine transportation puts significant constraints on the size of the hydrogen containers. However, marine transportation of liquid hydrogen may not have a means of recovering the boil-off gas.  Key decision points distinguishing compressed hydrogen gas and liquid hydrogen are presented. Additionally, options for on-board refrigeration and use of boil-off gas are also discussed.  The presentation provides an introduction to hydrogen storage and transportation and the impacts of using liquid hydrogen during storage and transportation vis a vis compressed hydrogen gas, as presented in a series of graphics and charts. This allows the session participant to understand the key issues with onshore storage and marine transportation of hydrogen.}

	abstract		= {This technical paper assesses the mooring integrity of a floating structure unit in offshore Peninsular Malaysia post-Tropical Storm PABUK. The study focuses on a Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) unit, experiencing significant forces during the storm, which recorded the highest wave height and wind speed in the region. Using industry software, the paper reviews design criteria for station-keeping analysis under intact and damage conditions during the 100-year return period. Initial analysis reveals criteria were below recent data recorded for PABUK. Sensitivity analysis studies incrementally increased environmental load cases in all directions of attacking waves and winds. Mooring line strength capacity was evaluated against Abnormal (ALS) criteria, considering survival from significant wave heights of 5m to 9m, equivalent to over a 10,000-year return period. Results indicate mooring lines could perform above design values, surviving the storm without failure. The study establishes a threshold capacity for surviving future storm events and introduces a corresponding integrity alert level for the floating structure unit. The paper highlights the novelty of determining the threshold limit for a floating structure unit, enabling data-driven decision-making for operators. Successful mitigation during the storm is attributed to a measurement system providing real-time storm characteristics for emergency response. The paper explores the historical context of tropical storms in the South China Sea, focusing on Tropical Storm PABUK's impact on PETRONAS operational waters. It discusses the development stages of tropical storms, their geographical distribution, and analyzes real-time metocean observations during PABUK's passage. The study emphasizes the importance of weather warnings, forecast accuracy, and risk assessments for enhancing preparedness in the face of tropical storms. The methodology and analysis section details mooring analysis using OrcaFlex software, considering Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) and conducting a time-domain approach. The study evaluates mooring chain tensions, rolling behavior, and excursion offsets, providing a holistic understanding of the challenges posed by tropical storms. In conclusion, the paper contributes valuable insights to offshore engineering, risk management, and weather forecasting. Recommendations include enhanced forecasting, reevaluating offshore structure resilience, continued monitoring, adaptive design strategies, and collaborative research initiatives. The findings aim to inform industries operating in tropical storm-prone regions, fostering resilience, safety, and sustainability.}

	abstract		= {In this paper, the main findings and developments pertaining to the Gentle Driving of Piles (GDP) method are presented, addressing various aspects of monopile installation. GDP introduces an innovative vibratory installation method for tubular (mono)piles, utilizing simultaneous low-frequency axial and high-frequency torsional vibrations to enhance the pile installation performance, while curbing underwater noise emissions during driving. To support the earliest development of the GDP method a multi-fold research programme has been carried out, including laboratory experiments, field testing, and advanced numerical modelling. The first field tests at the Maasvlakte II site (Port of Rotterdam, The Netherlands) successfully demonstrated the use of GDP in sandy soil in terms of (enhanced) installation as well as post-installation response to lateral cyclic loading. Furthermore, numerical modelling work was undertaken, addressing the aspects of drivability, vibro-acoustics and lateral response to cyclic loading. This paper provides novel insights into sustainable monopile installation, addressing challenges related to installation performance, lateral loading response, and vibro-acoustics. GDP emerges as a propitious solution for future offshore monopile installation, contributing to the ambitious goals of the offshore wind sector.}

	abstract		= {In the frame of a Research and Development (R\&D) project dedicated to quantitative ground modelling, Underwater Multichannel Analysis Surface Waves (UMASW) data were acquired within an offshore windfarm area currently in development in North Sea. The ultimate goal of the project described in this paper was to test the added value of the shear wave velocity (Vs) interpreted from the UMASW, particularly as a propagation tool of the geotechnical information. This requires a suitable Vs dataset within the foundation depth and the quantification of the associated uncertainties. The Vs of the ground is generally accessed in one dimension (1D) through geotechnical borehole (P-S-Primary \& Shear seismic wave- logging or laboratory sample testing) or through S-CPT (Seismic Cone Penetration Test) in-situ testing within the offshore wind industry. The present acquisition was then an opportunity to compare both UMASW and borehole results, and to assess the spatial variability of the Vs around the boreholes.  The UMASW acquisition was designed to allow a pseudo three-dimensional ({3D}) gridding of the data, with a 10m bin size, and to reach a minimal signal penetration depth of 60m below seabed (bsb), compatible with the geotechnical investigation. Two block areas of about 400m \texttimes{} 300m, each centered around a borehole location, have been investigated together with a corridor area of 2300m \texttimes{} 20m tying the blocks. The spread used for the acquisition includes a sledge equipped with a 60cu.  in airgun and a 166m long streamer with 48 channels. The sledge, dragged on the seabed, was tracked along intended 10m spaced lines with a shot point interval of 10m. The data processing was done for each shot and includes the manual picking of the dispersive curves and a 1D inversion modelling. The pseudo {3D} gridding was then carried out by interpolation with the closest neighbors.  The results are found to be of good quality, with clear dispersive curves and a signal penetration reaching about 80m bsb. The standard deviation of the processed Vs remains generally below 3\%. A first comparison of the Vs with the existing 2D Ultra High Resolution Seismic (UHRS) reflection data shows a good stratigraphic match with the key seismic horizons, while detailing some significant variability across the corresponding units. While UMASW, together with seismic refraction, is regularly used to characterize the ground for burial or trenching purpose, it appears to also bring valuable design parameters for the offshore wind turbine foundations.}

	abstract		= {A comparison assessment of lateral buckle (LB) formation among three typical buckle mitigation devices (sleeper, distributed buoyancy modules (DBM), and residual curvature method (RCM)) commonly considered in the design of high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) flowlines is carried out by adopting a probabilistic approach based on Virtual Anchor Spacing Finite-Element (VAS FE) modeling to assess buckle initiation reliability. The pros and cons of each device are detailed, the critical stochastic parameters and deterministic parameters for the buckle formation associated with each device are identified, and a probabilistic assessment via a case study is carried out using the three mitigation devices for a subsea deep-water HPHT production flowline.  The probabilistic assessment of pipeline lateral buckling includes the following: (1) Calculation of the critical buckling force (CBF) and its probability density function for both engineered and rogue buckles based on deterministic and stochastic parameters via Monte-Carlo simulation and design of experiments (DOE); (2) Determination of the tolerable VAS by FE analyses for both engineered and rogue buckles to satisfy the design criteria; (3) Positioning of the engineered buckles along the flowline through a reliability analysis using BUCKFAST.  The analysis results indicate that the stochastic parameters that control the buckling formation are different for each of the three mitigation methods. Comparison of the three methods showed that the RCM option had the most significant impact on reducing the CBF due to the influence of the pipe/soil lateral breakout friction factor while the DBM option had the least significant impact, with the highest CBF among the studied mitigation devices. Results also show that some of the stochastic parameters do not have significant effects on the CBF for each considered mitigation device and therefore could be treated as deterministic parameters in future analyses. The competition between the CBF of rogue buckles along the curve section and the trigger CBF distribution is the key parameter when comparing the different mitigation methods. Sleeper and DBM options may not satisfy the LB design criteria in some cases when using the deterministic approach, especially for a rough seabed profile along the route, but may lead to a solution when using a probabilistic assessment. RCM has the advantages of a lower CBF and the lowest cost among the three mitigation methods, which means the RCM is a cost-effective lateral buckle mitigation solution for subsea HPHT pipelines.}

	abstract		= {As deepwater wells age and reservoir pressure drops, wells have the potential to enter a subambient state in which shut in wellhead pressure is below ambient seawater hydrostatic pressure. Standard intervention pressure control and completion equipment is typically designed to prevent positively pressured wellbore fluids from flowing to sea, not prevent the sea from flowing into the well, with pressure integrity evaluated based on net internal pressure, not net external pressure. This poses a multitude of risks ranging from developing hydrates in pressure control equipment to uncontrolled flow of seawater into wellbores or flowlines. Managing subsea riserless intervention operations in this state requires additional assurance at both an equipment component level and an operational execution level to maintain well control and execute operations safely.  A formal assurance process was developed to establish the integrity capability of subsea riserless intervention equipment under significant subambient well conditions (\textgreater{} 2,000 psi net external pressure). This was a collaborative effort between the operator, intervention vessel contractor, and original equipment manufacturers. Equipment was evaluated at both a component and system level to verify capability, and operating parameters and procedures were revised to maintain well control and well integrity under net external pressure conditions. The results of this process were formally documented to allow risks and safeguards to be clearly communicated to offshore personnel executing well intervention operations.  Multiple significantly subambient riserless well interventions have been executed by BP in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa to-date. Multiple equipment options and intervention methods have been developed into standard operations, resulting in significant production uplift with no major incidents seen in operations relating to seawater ingress or intervention equipment failure due to net external pressure. As part of this process, BP applied for and received the first BSEE approval to allow consideration of external seawater hydrostatic pressure to develop a depth adjusted working pressure for subsea intervention equipment.}

	abstract		= {Monopiles are the most common type of foundation currently used in the offshore wind industry. Operators may elect to instrument and monitor foundations to assess the system behavior or support integrity management. For monopile foundations, the region below the seabed is critical since this region sees the largest bending loads in the monopile. The offshore wind industry can benefit greatly from sub seabed measurement systems as they can provide vital information regarding structural health and provide data to optimize future designs. However, installing sensors below the seabed is a non-trivial task that can occupy significant costs to engineer and implement such systems, which is a challenge in an industry that commands low-cost solutions. This paper presents an engineering study of two sensor cover concepts designed for implementation of sub seabed monitoring on a monopile foundation. The two concepts selected are designed to be fabricated from off-the-shelf components, producing a low-cost solution to sub seabed monitoring. Furthermore, the design relies on a combination of sub-scale testing and quasi-static analysis to reduce design costs and help support a low-cost solution.  Both strength and fatigue were considered in the design. Strength analysis was performed using a finite element analysis ({FEA}) where a series of acceleration loads, intended to represent the acceleration spectrum that would be present during pile driving, were applied to the protection systems in a quasi-static analysis. Additionally, a fatigue analysis is performed for the bolted connections on one concept using the stresses from the {FEA}. Two concepts were tested via a pile driving test with a sheet pile. The pile driving process was monitored and accelerations for each blow were measured during the testing. One of the two concepts tested survived the pile driving testing with accelerations measuring up to 900g, while the other failed.  The analysis and testing performed for this design showed that the sub seabed sensing on monopile foundations can be built from low-cost steel components, given proper collaboration between with the monopile designers/fabricators and the measurement system provider. Furthermore, this work has shown that sub seabed sensing for offshore wind monopile foundations can be done in a reliable, cost-effective manner that utilizes efficient design practices and is manufactured from commercially available, low-cost materials and components. Additionally, this work serves as an enabling solution for integrity management of offshore wind farms to help reduce operation and maintenance (O\&M) cost.}

	abstract		= {Fundamentally, existing mooring systems are based on the conventional theory of ``Length-Fixed Tension-Varying" (LFTV), i.e., the physical length of the mooring line between the mooring fairlead on the floater and the anchor on the seabed is fixed and the mooring line tension varies as the floater moves. For the existing LFTV mooring system, the line tension is highly dynamic. It can increase exponentially as the offset of the floater increases and the mooring line is tightened to its full physical length under extreme wind and wave loading. This causes significant challenges in mooring system design particularly for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) in shallow water of 50\textasciitilde{}100m depth. Another challenge is that the existing catenary mooring system typically has a large footprint on the seabed which may have negative impacts on the marine environment.  In this paper, a new fixed tension mooring theory of "Length-Varying Tension-Fixed'' (LVTF) is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the existing mooring systems. Based on the new mooring theory, novel LVTF mooring configurations are developed for shallow water FOWT applications. Discussions are given on the mooring system restoring force for the novel LVTF mooring concept in comparison with existing catenary mooring. A simplified two-line system is used to illustrate the new mooring theory. Conceptual design of a three-line single shared anchor (SSA) LVTF mooring system is performed and numerical analyses are conducted for a semi-submersible platform supporting the IEA 15 MW wind turbine in shallow water. The results show that the novel ultra-small footprint SSA LVTF mooring concept is highly feasible for station-keeping of the FOWTs. It provides a highly cost-effective and environmental-friendly solution with improved safety and efficiency to the mooring challenges for shallow-water FOWTs. The next step is to conduct proof-of-concept model tests and prototype pilot tests to gain further insights and validate the novel LVTF mooring system conceptual design.}

	abstract		= {Floating wind turbine structures are subjected to complex fatigue damage resources, such as wave dynamic, blade motion, turbine vibration, wind turbulence, structure vibration and so on. A study of a semi-submersible wind turbine structure has revealed that the load from wind turbine significantly affects the fatigue behavior of the structure. However, how the load is comprised and how impacts fatigue life is unknown. Lately developed fully coupled time domain global analysis are capable of getting the time history of wind turbine tower bottom load. A study is performed to analyze the load the get the components of the loads. To get fatigue life of the whole structure, a complete structure model instead of hydro model is required. Due to the complication of the fully coupled time domain structural analysis, it is required to develop a methodology for coupling wind and wave impact on the fatigue life of the structure. In this study, time domain wind turbine load is used to compute the fatigue life due to wind and spectral fatigue method is used to computer fatigue life caused by wave. Then the fatigue damages were combined and compared to give suggestions for the future floating wind turbine structures.}

	abstract		= {Recently, the offshore wind industry is transitioning from the fixed-bottom in shallow waters to the floating in deep waters. This shift requires station-keeping anchors to stabilize turbines. Maximizing the cost-effectiveness and installation efficiency of anchor foundations is critical for project success. Suction anchors offer an efficient installation method by creating an underpressure to penetrate the seabed without noise from hammering like driven pile anchors. This foundation concept, well-established in the oil and gas industry, holds promise for floating offshore wind applications. Traditionally, the top cap is fixed on the suction anchor after installation to provide a sealed condition inside for better vertical holding performance. However, in the case of a catenary mooring system in soft clay, where horizontal loads dominate, the conventional fixed top cap may not be necessary. Instead, a retrievable top cap can be designed, offering cost savings and ensuring full embedment of the anchor in the seabed, enhancing its capacity, and mobilizing more soil in deep areas. This study presents a series of numerical modelling to investigate the horizontal capability of the suction anchors in clay with retrievable top caps. Comprehensive numerical simulations were performed, which were validated first against the existing studies in literatures for traditional suction anchor with fixed top cap. A parametric study was then carried out to assess the effects of the retrievable top cap length, anchor length to diameter ratio (L/D), padeye location, and loading angle on the anchor horizontal capacity. Consistent with the existing studies, the failure mechanism of horizontally loaded suction anchor change with the padeye location, which transforms from a rotation failure to horizontal translation failure as the padeye location increase from seabed to around 0.6L (anchor length) and provides the highest horizontal capacity, although it should be noted that the padeye location is also affected by the loading angle. For the anchor with retrievable top cap, almost the same horizontal capacity was observed when the L/D ratio is larger than 1. In addition, when the retrievable top part extends to upper part of anchor, a higher capacity factor can be obtained due to the increased embedment and the mobilization of deep soil. Compared with the anchor with fixed top cap, the optimum padeye location of anchor with retrievable top part will also change to a shallower depth at around 0.5L.}

This will require development, adoption, and deployment of innovative technologies in support of both traditional energy and emerging forms of lower-carbon energy. A foundational aspect of meeting these needs is the industry's use of standardization, and that, too, should be applied to implementation of these new technologies. The advancement of innovative technologies is foundational to American Petroleum Institute's (API) Climate Action Framework (CAF) initiative to accelerate technology to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs.  While API has several initiatives well underway in the form of funded research to help meet this challenge, API has also moved quickly to address emerging needs in the form of standards and other initiatives. These include the publications of:API Technical Report 1533, Lubricants Life Cycle Assessment and Carbon Footprinting \textendash{} Methodology and Best Practice, First Edition, May 2023;API Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emergency Response Tactical Guidance Document: Guidelines for Preparedness and Initial Response to a Pipeline Release of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), August 2023, created with the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association (LEPA) and developed with input from the National Association of State Fire Marshals; andThe development with the Offshore Operators Committee of API Recommended Practice 75W, Safety and Environmental Management System for Offshore Wind Operations and Assets, with the first edition anticipated mid-2024.  Of particular interest is that both the CO2 emergency response document and Recommended Practice 75W have involved working with both traditional and nontraditional partnering organizations, which could lead to broader acceptance and use.  Likewise, it is especially important in implementing these technologies and operations to engage non-traditional stakeholders to ensure robust consensus. API is leading the way on this critical issue as well with its Industry in Action: Focus on Environmental Justice report, published June 2023. This approach is embodied in API's CAF text that ``Meeting this challenge requires new approaches, new partners, new policies and continuous innovation.''}

Established in 2021, the JIP investigates geotechnical behavior of glauconite sands in relation to pile installation and long-term performance as relevant to offshore wind energy development along the U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The JIP comprises five energy developers and is led by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. The scope of work comprises (i) characterization of an onshore glauconite test site in New Jersey and glauconite/glauconitic sands from offshore lease areas, (ii) steel pipe piles driven using hydraulic and vibratory hammers, (iii) and axial tension, axial compression and lateral pile load testing. Novel site investigation methods include the effect of friction reducer geometry on cone penetration testing (CPT) resistance, cyclic CPT including water injection, and sampling of degraded glauconite sand from pile walls. The detailed instrumentation program included accelerometers and strain gauges during driving, grout-embedded sister bar strain gauges during axial compression and tension load testing, and fiber Bragg grating optical sensor measurement during axial compression and lateral load testing. In this paper, we present analysis of the CPT data and pile installation data including soil resistance to driving (SRD) and pile-soil setup during redrives/restrikes, and describe novel in situ sampling and testing of degraded glauconite sand. Degradation experienced by the glauconite sands during pile installation is consistent with observations from other regions including Belgium and is compared to artificial degradation performed in a laboratory setting. The JIP is the first comprehensive field and laboratory test program investigating glauconite sand behavior in the U.S. The data being collected is providing offshore wind developers an opportunity to reduce uncertainty and risk in pile installation and long-term performance, and gain insights into glauconite sand variability and geotechnical behavior across the U.S. Atlantic OCS to aid in future lease area development.}

This work uses QuesTek's ICMD\textregistered{} software platform including thermodynamics- and kinetics-based databases and modeling as well as physics-based analytical modeling and simulation approaches to predict process-structure-property relationships in structural alloys. Using these predictive modeling tools, the composition and processing are optimized to achieve improved performance.

Specifically, stress-corrosion cracking susceptibility and strength of alloys was explored and the sensitivity within specification ranges was examined. The results showed that these methods can be used to tighten specification ranges and adjust heat treatments to improve robustness of material performance for a given application.  Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) is a relatively new approach to materials engineering which leverages the many advancements in both physics-based modeling and computational speed over the last couple of decades. The materials genome initiative has pushed for the utilization of ICME to improve novel materials design and development as well as improving alloy optimization, qualification, and troubleshooting of materials challenges for insertion of existing materials into new applications. This methodology has been growing in use in many industries (e.g., aerospace, space, defense, biomedical, automotive, nuclear, etc.) but its use in the Petroleum industry is still relatively limited. This work outlines how this approach could be adopted for practical oil and gas applications, and what the benefits would be.}

Considerations and provisions required in the subsea system to accommodate certain surveillance technologies are highlighted. In this paper, the potential path taken by CO2 molecules are followed through a subsea storage system, with leak detection and plume surveillance in mind.  Feasibility and opportunities for using monitoring methods and leak detection technologies were assessed by utilizing an assessment matrix which summarises the various advantages and disadvantages of plume monitoring technologies and leak detection methods. The following aspects were assessed for each technology: 1. Technical feasibility; 2. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and development required; 3. Impact of the solution on the subsea system (e.g. field architecture, power and communication); 4. Relative costs; 5. Schedule (e.g. added risk due to development required).  Leak detection methods having unknown efficacy and limited research in CO2 applications were screened out. Those methods which have been field tested for CO2 service or currently under lab testing were advanced to a second stage of screening by product specifications to further consider their integration into the subsea injection system design. Passive acoustic technology was found to be the best suited for detection across subsea infrastructure as it covers a desirable detection radius at the lowest cost. Screening of plume monitoring methods showed benefits and drawbacks of each method evaluated; the review concluded that different technologies should be used at different stages of a subsea CCS project. Near well bore, CO2 migration monitoring can be performed using Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) as it yields a high-resolution image in the vicinity of the well. When the plume eventually outgrows VSP's radius of investigation, a sparse acquisition strategy can later be used to verify conformance of reservoir model's plume migration at strategic locations. Finally, leak detection tools such as an AUV with side scan sonar and a chemically degraded trigger and beacon could be used for leakage from the reservoir through the seabed and legacy wells respectively.  This paper provides a novel integrated view of CO2 escape paths, bringing together topics around CO2 leak detection from subsea injection equipment, sub-surface plume monitoring and leakage from reservoir through the seabed. The results of this research can benefit CCS projects in the concept phase influencing the design of subsea infrastructure to accommodate monitoring methods, thus guiding technology and risk assessments to support a Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) plan.}

In contrast to the stiff tendons in a conventional Tension Leg Platform (TLP), VMS is a ‘soft’ system with long natural periods in its heave, pitch and roll modes and alleviates the technical difficulties and cost challenges associated with the tendons of a TLP in deep water while maintaining a small footprint to avoid interference with neighboring mooring systems and power lines. In this paper the motion response of a VMS is investigated in both frequency domain and time domain for extreme and operating sea states. It is demonstrated that a VMS meets all the relevant design requirements and has a superb redundancy compared to a spread moored system. The heave stiffness of a vertical mooring system makes it possible to tune the heave natural frequency closer to the heave cancellation frequency thus minimizing heave resonance response. A VMS also have better pitch and roll motions than a conventional spread moored semisubmersible because of the additional rotational stiffness from the vertical moorings.}

For both deep space and deep ocean, there is much to be learned from other sectors such as the medical industry as well. For example, medical imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans resemble the non-destructive testing techniques used in space and deepwater energy business. Similarly, robotic surgery is analogous to Mars Rovers and remotely operated vehicles used under water, and remote patient monitoring for more personalized and effective healthcare is comparable to the data analytics and machine learning used for proactive health monitoring in deep space and deep ocean.

	abstract		= {In wind turbine design, various critical aspects demand attention, including wind turbine design, assessment of floater structure, and optimization of the mooring system. Turbine designers prioritize control system optimization, relying on predicting responses like power generation and nacelle accelerations. Evaluating floater structure involves motion responses and loads on interface positions, like the tower base and mooring fairleads. The latter is crucial for positioning system optimization. These considerations often necessitate a comprehensive simulation of the entire system.  This paper conducts a comparative study of outputs of wind turbine, motion performances of the floater, and tensions of the mooring lines, involving various simulations using different mooring models, exploring both frequency and time domains. In the frequency domain, it begins with hydrodynamic analysis using equivalent springs and proceeds to a statistical analysis with a catenary mooring line model. Emphasizing time domain analysis, the paper extensively compares results from coupled analysis with a quasi-static catenary mooring model and a dynamic finite element mooring model. The wind turbine and floater models are kept identical, encompassing three power generation design load cases and two parked cases. The assumption is that the quasi-static approach can significantly reduce coupled analysis time, prompting an examination of its accuracy for the mentioned design focuses.  The conclusion reveals that, overall, the results for wind turbines and the tower\textemdash{}such as power generation, nacelle accelerations, and tower base moments\textemdash{}are very similar using two different mooring models in time domain analysis. Regarding floater motions, both approaches yield comparable results in the wave frequency range, but the quasi-static model tends to overpredict low-frequency responses. This conservative tendency affects global performance prediction more than structure assessment, as the latter mainly relies on wave frequency responses. Fairlead tension statistics show similar outcomes, but the power spectrum density indicates that the quasi-static mooring line may miss dynamic aspects. For capacity checks, the quasi-static approach remains valid, while it's recommended to use the dynamic FEM mooring line model for fatigue checks. A simplified approach may still be practical to streamline analysis for design iterations.}

	abstract		= {Pressure transient analysis (PTA), as a powerful technique for CO2 injection data analysis, plays an essential role in assessing the CO2 storage performance of saline aquifers. However, the appearance of the two-phase CO2/brine flow together with pressure-dependent properties introduces significant nonlinearity into the governing equation and makes the use of PTA erroneous. Accordingly, we presented a two-phase approach to estimate the storage capacity and spatial distribution of CO2 plumes by analyzing injection data.  The proposed method consists of an analytical two-phase flow model for CO2 injection in saline aquifers and a straight-line analysis approach for estimating the CO2 storage capacity. The PTA model incorporates the two-phase flow of CO2-brine, and the boundary condition of moving CO2 injection front by employing a modified equation of the distance of investigation. To account for the pressure-dependent reservoirs properties, we established new definitions of pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time and reached the analytical solutions. In addition, approximate solutions in straight-line form are obtained to appraise the CO2 storage potential through an iterative workflow.  We assessed the precision of our proposed method by conducting tests with synthetic data. This data was generated from four numerical cases related to CO2 storage in saline aquifers, simulated under constant injection rate and bottom-hole pressure conditions. We presented a two-phase diagnostic plot to identify transient and boundary-dominated flow regimes. A two-phase specialty plot is proposed to calculate essential reservoir parameters and the CO2 storage capacity. The numerical validation confirms the accuracy of the proposed method with an extremely low relative error in estimating CO2 storage capacity. The good match demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in the quick evaluation of storage potential over the numerical simulation. Additionally, the method offers early detection of leakage through the prediction of the CO2\textendash{}brine front.  Instead of assuming constant CO2 properties in two-phase PTA, this paper incorporates pressure-dependent fluid properties into a straight-line analysis approach by defining new pseudo-properties. Unlike the prior single-phase model without an injection front, the moving boundary condition of CO2 injection front is considered in the superposition pseudo-time to provide a more accurate estimation of CO2 storage capacity. This study shows that the use of PTA along with a simple CO2 injection model is simple yet rigorous for CO2 storage projects.}

	abstract		= {Shock loading and damage to drill bit cutters caused by changes in rock formations has long been a challenge, especially for shoulder cutters that are subjected to the highest cutting forces. To overcome this problem, a breakthrough solution is emerging\textemdash{}the ``Adaptive'' polycrystalline diamond compact ({PDC}) bit, designed with cutters mounted onto a specially engineered elastic structure. This innovation aims to mitigate damaging vibrations, extend bit lifespan, and improve penetration rates in highly heterogeneous formations. However, the development of this elastic structure presents unique requirements\textemdash{}limited size, high force tolerance, low compression set, fast frequency response, and resistance to downhole corrosion and erosion. Current commercial solutions are inadequate, requiring the development of a novel, reliable, and cost-effective elastic material or structure for this purpose-built application.  In this study, Finite Element Analysis ({FEA}) is conducted to determine the necessary properties of the elastic material for achieving optimal adaptive drill bit performance. Based on this criterion, several technical routes, including rubbers, enhanced rubber structures, shape memory Belleville, metal discs, and wire-woven structures, were thoroughly investigated. A significant number of samples, each designed with different material selections and structures, were fabricated and tested to determine the most appropriate solution for this purpose-driven application. This rigorous screening process aims to identify the ideal elastic material or structure that will revolutionize drill bit technology and pave the way for improved drilling efficiency in various rock formations.  Throughout the investigation, rubber and enhanced rubber structures proved inadequate due to their limited elastic force and compression set issues. Similarly, shape memory alloys, despite various designs, were unsuitable due to their non-linear elastic properties and poor machinability. Conventional metal discs faced fatigue issues, particularly under high frequency conditions. As a result, wire-woven structures emerged as the most promising candidates after meticulous testing, involving proper raw material selection and an optimized braiding method. In drill bit cutting tests, this novel elastic structure demonstrated exceptional performance compared to traditional designs. It significantly stabilized cutter impact, effectively reducing wear rates by half. This remarkable improvement in drill bit longevity and stability brings a transformative advancement to drilling operations in various rock formations.  To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first successful implementation of the Wire-Woven Elastic Structure in an adaptive drill bit, revolutionizing drilling operations in highly heterogeneous rock formations with improved reliability and cost-effectiveness. This breakthrough also establishes a material-structure-performance relationship for this low-cost elastic material, opening up possibilities for its application in various downhole tools, including drilling, completion, workover, and more.}

	abstract		= {It is widely acknowledged that Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) constitutes an indispensable component in the global endeavor to mitigate carbon emissions by 15-20\%, thereby aligning with the 1.5\textdegree{}C (2.7\textdegree{}F) target set for 2050. Despite substantial governmental support, such as 45Q, progress in CCUS development and infrastructure remains sluggish, primarily attributed to the substantial initial capital outlays involved. A significant proportion of these costs can be attributed to the utilization of costly Corrosion-Resistant Alloys (CRA), necessitated by the harsh corrosion challenges posed by supercritical CO2 from the capture facility to the injection wells. To facilitate the advancement of CCUS technology in China, extensive research, testing, and development endeavors have been undertaken to identify and implement advanced materials and anti-corrosion technologies capable of replacing CRA within the CCUS injection well infrastructure.  The conditions of CO2 injection wells in four major oil fields in China have undergone thorough investigation and categorization. Minimum CRA requirements have been determined through a combination of field data and computer simulations, establishing cost upper limits for selecting new materials. Extensive testing has been conducted on a diverse range of new materials and anti-corrosion solutions, encompassing various grades of coatings, platings, liners, coil tubings, inhibitors, and their combinations. These tests have been carried out under simulated laboratory conditions as well as in the field to assess their long-term effectiveness.  Drawing upon comprehensive test results, the operational scope of each technology has been outlined. Among these, coating technology, encompassing various polymer coatings and alloy plating, emerges as the most cost-effective solution but offers relatively short-term protection (typically less than 5 years) when used independently. However, Ni-P or Ni-W plating, complemented by compatible inhibitor protocols, can reliably extend protection for 5-10 years. Polymer composite liners, such as Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) liners, provide extended lifespans (typically 20-50 years) and obviate the need for corrosion inhibitors due to their substantial thickness, albeit at roughly twice the cost. In exceptionally harsh conditions and for prolonged storage periods, CRA coil tubing emerges as a cost-efficient alternative to traditional CRA tubing. It offers cost savings by eliminating the fabrication and testing requirements associated with conventional gas-tight tubular connections.  To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first endeavor to provide substantive recommendations for replacing expensive traditional CRA in CCUS injection wells with alternative anti-corrosion solutions, substantiated by rigorous testing and extensive field experience. The findings of this research have the potential to empower operators worldwide to significantly reduce their project costs while maintaining safety and reliability. As a result, it can foster the expansion of CCUS initiatives, contributing to the attainment of global objectives in sustainable energy production and climate control.}

	abstract		= {Given the challenges posed by CO2's distinct thermophysical properties (i.e., its expansive behavior and attendant risks of causing hydrate, dry ice, and/or water ice formation), a dynamic multiphase flow simulator is employed to evaluate the effectiveness and suitability of using a subsea capping stack to respond to a CO2 well blowout.  A dynamic multiphase flow simulator is used to investigate a capping operation for CO2 well blowouts. Following the typical sequence of a capping procedure and applying a soft shut-in, different primary bore sizes and choke line configurations are considered. Additionally, different reservoir flow rates, fluid types (CO2 and CH4) and water depths are investigated \textendash{} all with the intention of understanding what differentiates a CO2 blowout from that of methane under varying conditions.  This study reveals that significant hydrate formation on the exterior of a capping stack is most probable for shallow-water, high-rate CO2 blowouts \textendash{} while the risk of dry ice is non-existent for all scenarios evaluated. Fluid temperatures can plummet to as low as 20\textdegree{} F across the capping stack's body and choke lines, suggesting frozen-water deposition on their exterior. In the context of the CH4 blowouts modeled, there's an absence of the temperature drop necessary to form significant hydrates on the capping stack's exterior. Further, while dimensions of the primary bore and choke lines certainly influence temperature drops, their overall impact is marginal when compared to CO2's supercritical phase transition.  This paper delves into the underexplored realm of using subsea capping stacks for CO2 well blowouts, presenting new challenges and insights not widely discussed in existing literature. For engineers, the insights are useful, highlighting the differential risks associated with CO2 blowouts versus traditional hydrocarbon ones.}
