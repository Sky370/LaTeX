	abstract		= {The subsea test tree is a singular subsea safety solution for well test and cleanup operations from any floating rig. The test tree provides wellbore access, dual-barrier well control, and a reliable, fast-acting means to shut in a well and disconnect, in the event of an emergency. Currently, the ability to run and operate the string is severely dependent on the weather conditions due to its influence on the riser flex joint angles. Therefore, the maximum allowable flex joint angle places severe limitations on the weather operating windows. This study outlines the use of computational analysis to formulate the design changes that are needed to extend the current capabilities of the latch mechanism that secures the landing string inside the Blow Out Preventer (BOP). Simulations are conducted using a design of experiments methodology to enhance the asset’s bending ratings. A parametric analysis is conducted and components with geometric features that can potentially impede the sliding motion of the landing string, such as the latch skirt are explicitly modeled.  The finite element analysis ({FEA}) technique is used to identify the critical components, which can be further optimized to determine the geometric profile, which eventually ensures that the string passes through the riser flex joint without shouldering out at the BOP annular pockets with minimal push or pull force. The study extends the capability of the Subsea Landing String for use with higher flex joint angles and establishes the structural and functional load limits for the different operational scenarios. The solution highlights the importance of using computations in design as a viable alternative to expensive and time consuming experiments, especially when solving complex problems.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this research is to establish a validation process for survey correction algorithms, primarily focusing on the application of Multi-Station Analysis (MSA). While MSA represents a mathematical approach to survey error reduction, the application can result in varying levels of achieved accuracy. The adoption of a validation process to assess the accuracy of an MSA provider’s algorithm and processes would provide a framework within which to evaluate different providers.  The research will give an overview of the error sources in the ISCWSA error model and their impact on MWD surveys. A simulated well with survey depths and six-axis data will give a true known position of a well’s bottom hole location. Using the error model, randomized errors will be applied to the six-axis values to create a corrupted bottom hole location. A 3rd party proctor will distribute the corrupted six-axis data of 12 wells in varying azimuthal directions to the MSA provider to process through their algorithm. The corrected wellbore position will be returned to the proctor.  A chi-squared analysis of the results will show if the corrected wellbore positions fall within the expected accuracy level based on the error model. Companies will be assessed on both speed and accuracy. The results of the validation trial will establish the accuracy level that the MSA provider is able to achieve under given circumstances. The levels will be determined using wells inside and outside of the East-West Exclusion zone. The validation process will provide clarity to which error models should be assigned to a set of survey data when using a particular provider. For example, a certain provider might be able to achieve MWD+IFR1 accuracy as opposed to MWD+IFR1+MS under certain conditions. Whether or not checkshots are necessary will also be assessed during the validation process. Additionally, only error sources contained in the ISCWSA error model will be evaluated, and the magnitudes will be within the bounds of what can be reasonably expected in field application. Validation is widely accepted across many industries, including the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries, as a benchmark to ensure the safety of those using their products. As for MSA, improper application could cause inaccurate well placement resulting in well-collisions, or unknowingly crossing lease lines.  When planning a well, an Oil \& Gas company will be able to determine which MSA provider is qualified to provide accurate services based solely on the azimuthal direction of their wellbore and the target error model that they would like to achieve. The validation process will provide transparency to the MSA survey correction process and allow Oil \& Gas companies to ensure that the purchased product is meeting the advertised accuracy level.}

	abstract		= {Inorganic geopolymers typically consist of aluminosilicate-rich powders and alkali silicate solutions as hardeners. When these components are mixed, geopolymers exhibit a behavior similar to that of cement. The final product leaves a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to conventional cement. This paper offers a comprehensive characterization of a granite-based geopolymer designed for oilfield applications, adhering to the standard tests specified by API RP 10B-2. It also highlights the advantages and current limitations of this innovative technology while identifying areas for further research and development.  This geopolymer has been specifically engineered to completely replace Ordinary Portland Cement in well cementing applications. We conducted a series of tests, following API standards, to evaluate its fluid-state properties, including viscosity, static gel strength, thickening time, static fluid-loss, free fluid, and density. Additionally, we examined its mechanical properties after solidification, such as sonic strength development, uniaxial compressive strength, and volume change. Our analysis of the granite-based geopolymer demonstrates the effective performance of the dispersant, reducing viscosity, and enhancing mixability. We observed a brief gel transition time upon setting, and the mix exhibited slight expansion during the strength development phase. Notably, strength development remained continuous and did not plateau even after 30 days of curing. These geopolymers combine high compressive strength with exceptional flexibility. Furthermore, temperature sensitivity analysis revealed that an 8\textordmasculine{}C increase did not affect the gelation time.  This granite-based geopolymer is a cement-free system with a low calcium content, measuring less than 15\% by weight. It presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for replacing Portland cement in oil wells, both during well construction and abandonment. Moreover, it proves to be an excellent choice for constructing CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) and geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Automated rig pump startup sequences are a common component of rig control systems (RCS) where the operator programs a sequence to the controller for its execution. This sequence is entered manually and it does not change unless the operator modifies it. The current paper presents a new approach towards pumps management, where the startup sequence is updated automatically for every new startup event, considering the current state of the equipment and the formation downhole.  A digital twin of the wellbore equipped with physics-based transient models calculates the hydraulic parameters to build the startup sequence for every pump startup event. The startup sequence is updated continuously and automatically while drilling using the current state of the formation and rig equipment as inputs. The sequence calculated by the digital twin in real-time is then transmitted to a hydraulics automation application to monitor the execution of the startup events. In addition, the hydraulics application can write the startup sequence to automated drilling control systems (ADCS) to execute the pump startup process using tailored sequences for every event.  The transient hydraulic model that enables the estimation of a safe and optimum pump startup sequence has been integrated into digital twins used during pre-job planning as well as in real-time deployments. The model successfully updates the startup sequence in response to changes in pressure limitations at surface and downhole. In addition, the model responds to changes in the gel formation process to adjust the startup sequence accordingly. Furthermore, the digital twin calculates the hydraulic limits to consider for an effective monitoring, such as the flow rate, surface pressure, flow rate gradient and pressure gradient at surface.  The calculated sequence and limits are transmitted to the hydraulics automation application, which monitors the execution of the startup sequence and calculates key performance indicators related to the process. This makes it possible to identify invisible lost time during startup operations. Furthermore, the startup sequence is exposed by the hydraulics automation application to ADCS to automate the execution of the startup and shutdown processes.  A case study from the North Sea confirms the effectiveness of the approach and illustrates its benefits. It illustrates the collaboration between multiple advisors and a single ADCS, when all features are deployed simultaneously in real-time, and then executed automatically by the ADCS. Four different applications were deployed in connection to the ADCS, namely the pump management application, tripping advisor, rate of penetration (ROP) optimization and stringer drilling (SD) advisor.  In contrast to mechanical automation practices, the proposed method automatically calculates a new sequence for the pumps for every new startup event, considering the pressure environment at surface and downhole. In addition, the sequence is transmitted to the ADCS for execution and real-time monitoring, closing the control loop to the equipment.}

	abstract		= {Drilling process automation has been a trending topic within the technical community, most recently discussed in SPE-212565-MS (Cayeux et al. 2023). Recovery control - specifically in the case of motor stalls - is not only integral to consistently completing automation control system execution, but also building confidence for the control system users and ultimate automation benefactors. Predicting, preventing, detecting, mitigating, and recovering motor stalls through automated recovery control solves an issue affecting most operators, contributing to additional bottom-hole assembly (BHA) damage and unplanned trips.  The recovery control system was designed with six major process control interfaces, two of which occur during on-bottom drilling: drilling while rotating and drilling while sliding. Each control interface is a means by which an external system can control the rig tools in a coordinated fashion, managing what control is currently active and ensuring the driller can ultimately assume control at any given time. The recovery control is customized and preconfigured with an observation window to execute the recovery process once the stall criteria has been breached while on-bottom drilling, sliding or rotating. The result is mitigated motor stalls that are consistently managed with a configurable automation system, less BHA damage, and no motor stall related unplanned trips - displaying both time and cost value.  After two years of testing the recovery control system internally, there were no undetected stalls, no false detections, and no unplanned trips due to motor stall, displaying detailed accuracy. The recovery control complements the process control, limit control, and manual control components of the automation control system to drill a stand effectively and consistently.  A complete and effective automation control system gives time back to the rig crew and allows for leadership development opportunities. The reliability gained through recovery control, faster than manual attempts, allows the driller to focus more time on safety and training the rig crew instead of monitoring differential pressure in the hopes of manually preventing a motor stall. In nearly all cases, stalls were detected faster with the automatic recovery control system compared to manual detection by the driller. Drillers cannot be expected to pay attention to the hundreds of potential drilling problems - a control system can.  There are systems claiming to identify motor stalls, but this recovery control is the only technology to date that actively detects and recovers the system from the stall.}

	abstract		= {The drilling industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, leading to increased efficiency, lower costs, and reduced emissions per production unit. As unconventional well construction complexity continues to increase, the next wave of innovation lies in process automation, offering improved consistency and the opportunity to enhance drilling engineering designs.  Effectively automating drilling a stand while minimizing human variability requires a scalable control system, providing adaptability, seamless implementation, and improved operational outcomes. The system requires high- and low-level process control components to effectively control rig machinery within the bounds of the machine limit controls. By using automation sequences while engaging and disengaging the drill bit, operational states such as breakover, optimal weight on bit (WOB), steady state hookload, and zeroing become easier to distinguish.  Through consistent implementation of process automation in drilling operations, the impact on operational outcomes became evident. Analysis of bit disengagement in a series of automatically drilled stands in the lateral revealed a consistent breakover range of 18 to 22 ft. This is particularly noteworthy as breakover is typically more challenging to identify and prone to variability in manual operations.  Zeroing WOB in the lateral at a predetermined drilling interval is common practice to calibrate the drilling system, and procedures provided by the operator are often conservative due to human variability resulting in slower process execution. While drilling automated stands in a lateral, it was determined the lowering sequence of the process could be reduced by half to effectively zero the WOB and differential pressure, reducing invisible lost time.  Not all invisible lost time and variability is human related; variability due to equipment design was reduced. Torquing drillpipe connections is essential to drilling a well. Development of high spec automated floor wrenches improved make-up connection torque accuracy and consistency primarily associated with fundamental tool design. These improvements led to a connection integrity paradigm shift, reducing manual tong usage by 99\%, effectively eliminating the need for high torque tongs at a wellsite, leading to improved tripping time and safety.  As drilling automation continues to evolve, the outcomes obtained through consistent process execution provide valuable insights. Additionally, this contributes to a decrease in emissions per unit of hydrocarbon production. Consistency through automation reveals new avenues for in-depth technical discussions on achieving safe and efficient drilling of progressively complex wells.}

	abstract		= {Being able to automate the Directional Drilling (DD) process has significant sustainability effects on the well construction through remote operations and also increased efficiency on the usage of drilling rigs.  In this paper, we will present our advancement on autonomous directional drilling highlighting recent achievements in delivering autonomous sections in numerous fields around the world.  Achieving this fully autonomous mode with rotary steerable system (RSS) applications is not a small feat. It requires state estimation algorithms that can fuse all available downhole measurements to precisely predict the location of the bit at all times. These outputs can further estimate the steering capacity while the bottomhole assembly (BHA) navigates through different formation layers to include a surface deviation controller, which will actively monitor any unexpected deviations and will take the appropriate course of actions to rectify the situation. The state estimation is then fed into a surface automation algorithm that will automatically perform the necessary downlinks and engage suitable downhole control modes inside the RSS tool.  Our autonomous directional drilling system is being utilized and field tested across numerous locations. The system derives the steering recommendations and automatically sends downlinks via the on-target well delivery solution system. This system provides the flexibility for our customers to better design their wellsite footprint accommodating traditional crew models or the ability to operate completely remote. It has been deployed in many countries and with different complexity of directional drilling BHAs. For RSS applications, the solution utilizes both surface and downhole technologies, that creates a symbiosis between the downhole close-loop control and the surface close-loop control for directional drilling.  A novel autonomous directional drilling solution is described here. This intelligent system can automatically derive and execute directional drilling decisions while augmenting the technical personnel’s insights into the drilling process whether they are still on the wellsite or in a remote operation center.}

	abstract		= {A previous paper (Bang, 2017) has described a general method for calculation of the probability of collision between two wellbores. The present paper focuses on the sections along both wells where the collision probability is significant. Our hypothesis for this study was that for such limited sections of the wellbores, approximations and alternative mathematical approaches might increase the computational efficiency without too large sacrifices of the result's accuracy.  The potential benefits have been investigated through numerical calculations. The results indicate that using a constant uncertainty instead of the actual, varying uncertainty across the entire close-proximity region may increase the computation efficiency. However, we also found that this approximation should be applied with care, because it may generally be difficult to define the constant uncertainty with sufficient accuracy, based on a priori data. Furthermore, we have evaluated the current method of calculating probabilities in metric space against calculating in Mahalanobis space. These two approaches are mathematically equivalent. For our implementation and limited range of testing, the two methods are about equal with respect to computation efficiency.  We have also identified some important topics for future studies. Among these are identification of adequate parameters and efficient algorithms for collision risk analysis at various well proximity ranges, and evaluation of the appropriateness of established model assumptions in light of the industry's current needs and practices.}

	abstract		= {High frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a major contributing factor to the drilling dynamics-related bottomhole assembly (BHA) failures. These failures are costly because they not only damage the drilling tools but also cause significant nonproductive time (NPT) to the operational activity. It is therefore highly desirable to measure and mitigate this dysfunction in real time.  We have built a high-performance drilling dynamics module, which enables real-time or recorded mode measurements of this HFTO phenomenon. Using this measurement, we can deliver actionable insights to the rig or the rig crew in real time. With data from more than 3000 runs, we can build a clearer understanding of the real characteristics of HFTO, its drivers, and the effects it has on our drilling systems.  We show that with increasing Weight on Bit (WOB) the amplitude of the HFTO will increase. However, at high WOB the dysfunction amplitude will drop, while the ROP continues to rise. As such there is a sweet spot with high ROP and low HFTO.  By integrating this database of drilling dysfunctions with our records of tool damage and nonproductive time, we can map the effect of HFTO onto different failure criteria. As a result, we can define new and better operational standards and generate real-time insights into what damage is more likely to occur and how to change drilling parameters, if needed, to prevent it or determine if the vibration will pass without incident.  We also show that although the rotary steerable tools we use are sensitive to the effect of HFTO, our measurement while drilling (MWD) tools are not. For this latter group the probability of damage is the same for runs with and without HFTO.  This paper discusses the method and results for this study.}

However, the performance of conventional lubricants is typically reduced in such brines. This paper describes the design and development of a new class of lubricant specifically designed for use in high salinity water-based drilling fluids.  A comprehensive literature review and a detailed laboratory testing program were undertaken to investigate the mechanism of drilling fluid lubricants under downhole conditions. The knowledge gained from this study was used to design a new class of lubricant that undergoes a chemical reaction with high salinity brines in order to activate the lubricant species and maximize performance.  A series of field trials were conducted on wells targeting the Montney formation in Western Canada. The drilling fluids consisted of solids-free sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and produced water brines with densities ranging from 1080 \textendash{} 1330 kg/m3. The wells had lateral lengths ranging from 1580 \textendash{} 4000 meters. The new lubricant significantly out-performed conventional lubricants on 100\% of the field trials and was able to achieve friction factors close to those of oil-based drilling fluids. A series of in-depth case studies are provided which highlight the unique performance characteristics of this novel drilling fluid lubricant.}

	abstract		= {Rotary steerable systems (RSS) were first introduced as push-the-bit systems in the late 1990s and were drilling in manual mode sending downlinks by mud pulses downhole. The point-the-bit RSS was introduced in 2003. The first automated mode, known as inclination hold, was introduced in 2003. This was followed by vertical mode in 2004 and by hold inclination and azimuth mode in 2008. The last well profile type, the curve section, was not automated until 2020 when curve control was implemented for push-the-bit RSS. Implementing curve control for push-the-bit RSS has reduced the frequency of downlinks sent from surface and has improved the rate of penetration, thereby supporting a sustainable digital solution for directional drilling and drilling engineering. Curve control for point-the-bit RSS was introduced to the field in mid-2022 and has opened new applications for downhole automation. Point-the-bit RSS has a different steering mechanism (fixed bend) and it has the sensor offset farther from the bit, which creates challenges for implementation of trajectory automation.  In our work, we analysed several case studies and examined new application opportunities for autonomy for trajectory automation based on the field results. Until mid-2022 directional drillers sent manual downlinks to point-the-bit RSS from the surface to follow a planned trajectory and hit the target. These downlinks sent a steering ratio to achieve desired dogleg severity (DLS) and a desired toolface to turn the well if needed. By introducing downhole automation, the Directional Driller is able to send curvature commands, and the tool determines steering ratio to achieve planned DLS by applying a closed-loop algorithm to drill the trajectory. The closed-loop system minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on trajectory response.  Point-the-bit RSS have shown the ability to drill different curve profiles in curve control mode from 2D build to {3D} build or drop. Some of the trajectories included a tangent section that were executed with DLS demand of zero. The case studies demonstrate that curve control mode has drilled entire hole sections while reducing the frequency of downlinks, increasing the rate of penetration, and increasing consistency.  Our work examined the next level of downhole automated directional trajectory control for point-the-bit RSS that is currently handled and controlled by the directional drillers (e.g., geometric and geological steering). The curve control mode minimizes the interactions with the surface and allows the driller/surface system to optimize the drilling parameters. The algorithm also minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on the trajectory response.}

	abstract		= {Traditional casing point selection fails to reflect influx dynamics and leverage managed pressure drilling (MPD) advancements in the well design process, which often leads to over-engineering and increased expenditure. This study proposes a new approach that integrates MPD into the casing design process, employing a reduced drift-flux model (RDFM) to account for complexity. The methodology aims to optimize casing design and enable real-time assessment of kick tolerance (KT) while drilling, exploiting opportunities for optimization.  In this study, we present a comprehensive approach for determining kick tolerance thresholds, considering current operating conditions and equipment limitations. Improving on industry-accepted rules of thumb for kick volume (25 bbl) and kick intensity (0.5 ppg), this work delivers a fit-for-purpose kick tolerance criterion. The research indicates that casing point selection can be significantly influenced by previously overlooked factors, such as the impact of temperature on formation stress, kick dilution in drilling fluid and annular distribution, as well as pressure and temperature effects and rig kick detection capabilities. Including these in the design criteria yields more accurate and efficient well construction planning and reduced well control risks. Practical case history results demonstrate the potential to extend critical sections by up to 60\% while increasing the manageable kick volume, consequently eliminating at least 2 casing strings out of a 7 string well design.  The proposed methodology is shown to be suitable for real-time implementation, allowing drillers to make more informed decisions about casing point selection and section length extension while still ensuring safe well operations. This enhances the flexibility of the drilling process and leads to the reduction and simplification of over-engineered well schematics and excess number of casing strings, resulting in significant well construction cost savings.  This work presents a novel approach for MPD well design and casing point selection, considering overlooked factors such as case-specific defined thresholds for kick volume and intensity, complex gas behavior, and temperature-dependent formation stresses for pressure evaluation. Furthermore, it extends the scope to the drilling process by introducing the real-time assessment of KT, generating additional opportunities for optimization, and improving well control safety. In addition, it proves the suitability of an RDFM model for KT assessment.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents an autonomous drilling advisory system powered by digital twins and AI solutions. Such an advisory system aims to automate real-time monitoring and parameter optimization, reduce subject-matter experts, and meet the demands for safer and more efficient drilling toward autonomous operation.  The methodology proposed in this research involves the creation of a comprehensive Digital Twin model that accurately replicates the drilling process by integrating hydraulic, thermal dynamic, and mechanical models. To ensure high model accuracy, an auto-calibration approach is developed, driven by real-time data, to fine-tune the Digital Twin models. Additionally, AI-based model reasoning techniques are employed to detect potential hazards and risks ahead of the bit proactively. This is achieved by comparing the ideal behavior of the digital twin replica with the actual behavior observed from downhole and the rig. As a result, real-time diagnostics are generated to supervise ongoing operations, accompanied by suggestions to mitigate identified risks. Furthermore, the system leverages the capabilities of the Digital Twin and optimization methods to create multiple combinations of operational parameters. These parameters are optimized by ranking the predicted performance derived from the Digital Twin. The optimized operational parameters are automatically generated as forward advice to drillers, enabling them to make informed decisions and enhance drilling performance.  Testing results on multiple wells from different operators are presented, showcasing the system's capabilities in real-time monitoring and drilling parameter optimization. The system demonstrates its effectiveness in providing diagnostic messages with early anomaly detection during drilling and casing running. These diagnostic warnings include losses, leakage, poor hole cleaning, and stuck pipe, enabling proactive intervention to mitigate risks. Furthermore, the system optimizes operational parameters during drilling and tripping in real-time without requiring human intervention. This optimization covers parameters such as flow rate, rotary speed (RPM), and rate of penetration (ROP) during drilling, and tripping speed during tripping in and pulling out of the hole. The time savings achieved through the use of optimized parameters are quantified for both cases, demonstrating a substantial improvement in operational efficiency while maintaining safety margins. The scalability and adaptability of the system are also highlighted, emphasizing its ability to accommodate diverse drilling scenarios and integrate with existing solutions in various deployment conditions.  The proposed methodology demonstrates the development of a robust and efficient system that enhances decision-making and improves drilling performance. In addition, the results highlight the potential benefits of combining AI and Digital Twin technologies in the drilling industry, paving the way for future innovations and advancements in the field.}

	abstract		= {Well construction requires the cooperation of subject matter experts with differing backgrounds. Each discipline has its own viewpoint on the topics addressed by the collaboration team, which complicates multi-disciplinary work. Software tools often embed these differences, rendering the exchange of data subject to the assumptions of the differing backgrounds and disciplines. This can pose significant risk to well, human, asset value and environmental safety. Well construction software applications need to be versatile enough to describe and interpret the meaning of exchanged data while allowing for the inherent assumptions.  Facts about data best describe the meaning of the exchanged data. A semantic network can describe the relationships between concepts or meanings, which it does by collecting and relating facts about the data. The existing data repositories used in well construction use predefined and agreed upon meanings for the contained data. A semantic network, however, allows software applications to interpret the meaning of the transferred data, even when the original meaning and inherent assumptions are different from that of the receiving application. Obviously, the manual generation of such semantic information by end-users is not practical. Each software application needs to generate and interpret semantic information alongside the published data.  A simple example illustrates the potentially costly consequences of the differing meanings of exchanged information in a multi-disciplinary well construction environment. Three different end-users\textemdash{}a geomechanics engineer, a drilling engineer, and a measurement-while-drilling (MWD) engineer\textemdash{}exchange information, using computer applications, about downhole pressure measurements acquired during a drilling operation. The downhole pressures are in equivalent mud weight (EMW) units. Due to the different disciplines involved, each application utilizes a different definition when converting downhole pressure to EMW. The assumptions related to the accuracy of not only the mud density but also the vertical depth, then create expectations that may not be in line with reality, and each of the three different users themselves have different uncertainty expectations.  These different definitions require information on context to avoid misinterpretation. If the three applications can document the meaning of the exchanged data and can interpret the meaning of the received semantical information, then they can mitigate the risk of incorrect interpretation of the EMW data and provide quantification of the associated uncertainties. The scenario described also covers a change in context from conventional drilling to a well control incident. A different interpretation of the meaning of the data must follow the change in context. The paper explains how the three applications can describe the meaning of the exchanged data in order to correctly interpret information and manage the associated uncertainties both in terms of expectations as well as results.  Digitalization of the drilling industry is progressing rapidly, accompanied by the ability to exchange information between computer systems. This clearly breaks down the walls between the different disciplines involved in well planning and drilling operations. It is also important to recognize the uncertainty expectations between disciplines. These expectations must be managed so that the assumptions made are harmonious. To maximize potential opportunities, it is important to maintain the quality of information exchanged between computer systems to mitigate the introduction of significant risk to well, human and environmental safety.}

	abstract		= {Tripping operations are the source of possible serious drilling incidents caused by swab and surge pressures exceeding the geo-pressure margins. Yet, it is difficult to monitor the actual downhole pressure during tripping because of telemetry limitations but also because there are no available methods to measure downhole pressure below the bit. Hydraulic models are therefore necessary to estimate the downhole pressure along the whole open hole section, also below the bit. It is therefore important to understand the factors influencing downhole pressure estimations when the drill-string is only subject to axial displacement.  In most cases tripping procedures consist in a series of drill-string movements intertwined with connection procedures. While tripping, the drill-string needs to accelerate from a stand-still position and to stop at another position. As a result of these accelerations and decelerations, hydraulic calculations must be transient. Furthermore, the movement of the bottom of the string is not synchronous with the top of string displacement because of the elasticity of the string, meaning that transient torque and drag estimations are also necessary. Actually, when using a floater, the top of string movement is influenced by heave also during connection. When the drill-string is displaced, drilling fluid needs to be added or is returned to the trip tank, depending on the direction. Consequently, the drilling fluid columns in the string and in the annulus change position affecting the downhole temperature conditions. As the fluid density and viscous behavior depends much on the local condition of pressure and temperature, heat transfer estimations also play a role on downhole pressure estimations. The evaluation of downhole pressure requires the combined estimations of transient hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer models.  The drilling fluid is also subject to gelling in a non-uniform manner along the borehole. Drilling fluid with high viscosity at low shear rate may take several minutes to return to hydrostatic conditions like for example during connection. Depending on the static and kinetic friction factors, part of the drill-string may remain stretched also after the top of string movement has stopped. Consequently, connection time influences the swab and surge variations for the next stand. Therefore, a tripping operation is typically a non-holonomic process which requires a continuous follow-up of the time evolution of the hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer variables to be able to predict accurately the downhole pressure.  Through several examples from actual tripping operations, the importance of the mutual interaction between transient hydraulic, mechanic and heat transfer, as well as the non-holonomy of tripping operations is shown. Understanding the factors that influence swab and surge estimations is of paramount importance to progress with the automation of tripping operations.}

	abstract		= {Accurate measurement of the flow rate out of a well during drilling is essential for optimizing drilling performance and ensuring operational efficiency and safety. In conventional drilling, a flowmeter placed in the return flowline shall not introduce pressure drops and shall work without being filled. A new concept using a rotating measuring wheel fulfills these two requirements. However, it needs to be verified that the concept is sufficiently precise over the wide range of flowrates that can be experienced during a drilling operation as well as being accurate for non-Newtonian fluids containing cuttings and gas.  The measurement principle of the rotating wheel mass flowmeter involves directing the fluid, including cuttings and gas, through the center of a horizontal rotating wheel and collecting it via a funnel. The measuring wheel has vertical vanes onto which the drilling fluid applies a force due to the Coriolis acceleration. The forces on the vanes result in a torque that can be measured on the axle of the driving motor. This torque is directly proportional to the mass flowrate of fluid passing through the measuring wheel. To verify the accuracy of the sensor, a medium scale apparatus has been built and used in a flow-loop together with a high precision vibrating tube Coriolis flowmeter for reference. The test procedures consist of measuring flowrates with a range scale of 5 to 120 kilograms per minute with various drilling fluids.  The medium scale apparatus successfully handled flow rates up to the expected operational limit with optimal rotational speeds identified for different flow rates. The experiments encompassed various fluids, including water, glycerin (representing high-viscosity Newtonian fluid), and non-Newtonian drilling fluid samples. During the tests, issues related to design, instrumentation, and control system were identified and addressed. The results of the tests confirm that the rotating wheel mass flowmeter establishes a linear relationship between torque and mass flow rate, and that this linear relationship is valid both at low and high rotational speeds.  The benefits of this new mass flowmeter include acceptable accuracy and reduced maintenance requirements, and is also functional at very small rates, compared to traditional methods like the flow paddle. This research represents a significant step towards the development of a full-scale device, supporting an agile development process in the field of digitalization and automation of drilling operations.}

Research and development using data from multiple sources have led to the development of an intelligent hole-cleaning answer product that can be used for a wellbore risk reduction service. The service would aim to optimize the rate of penetration through better understanding of hole cleaning. This digital solution that will enhance the well construction process by optimizing hole cleaning in real time. This solution is best delivered by using a combination of data and processes from multiple sources such as along-sting measurements (ASM), surface data, and downhole tools. There are several applications for this service such as land drilling, deepwater wells, horizontal wells, multilateral wells, highly deviated wells, and extended reach drilling.  The service uses a combination of technologies previously only available as separate services. The service uses ASM sensors to optimize hole cleaning. Calibration of the cutting pressure profile with a real-time simulator using a multipoint pressure measurement along the string is provided. In addition to ASM sensors, the weight and volume of the cuttings are continuously recorded at the flow lines and compared to theoretical data. As a result, mud rheology, wiper trips, and drilling parameters can be optimized, and hole-cleaning best practices can be refined. Stuck pipe, cuttings bed buildups, and wellbore instability can be detected and mitigated against, enabling safer drilling and minimization of nonproductive time. This paper will showcase how this can be done and what visualizations can be shown. It is intended to give a peak at the solution developed.}

	abstract		= {Still images captured using mobile phone cameras have been shown to be very useful for bit forensics purposes. However, since still images can only capture views at certain viewing angles, they often provide insufficient information on each cutter's diamond table and substrate. Videos solve the problem of lack of view angles. This paper demonstrates how a video captured on a phone can provide additional bit information benefiting forensics, and provides recommendations for capturing videos to maximize information content.  Bit forensics as well as the future IADC dull grading system require meticulous data collection for various drill bit regions, including critical information such as blade numbers and cutter locations. To automate this process, this paper introduces a multi-stage approach using bit videos. Initially, a detection model is employed to accurately locate the drill bit within the video. Next, computer vision algorithms are utilized to segment the different blades. Spatial geometry algorithms are then applied to reconstruct the camera trajectory, which aids in estimating the blade numbers. Finally, each cutter within the segmented blades is further segmented into different regions.  This study explores the utilization of videos for the automated location segmentation of drill bits, a crucial aspect of the revised IADC dull grading system currently being proposed. The videos capture the entire drill bit from multiple angles, encompassing top-down views and a full 360-degree rotation. The IADC dull grading system necessitates the precise recording of position information including blade numbers, pocket numbers, and bit zones. By employing videos instead of still images, this study demonstrates that spatial geometric information of the drill bit can be obtained more completely and efficiently. Given a video that conforms to established shooting standards, the proposed automatic position calculation algorithm efficiently completes the segmentation of different parts of the drill bit and labels them in accordance with the relevant standards. Notably, video capturing offers several advantages over still photography; it obviates the need for complex training for operators, only necessitating adherence to basic camera trajectory guidelines, and substantially reduces the time needed to collect such data. Importantly, the location segmentation algorithm employed in this study is capable of running in real-time, thereby streamlining and accelerating the IADC dull grading and bit forensics processes.  This paper introduces a novel video-based algorithm for drill bit segmentation. The algorithm automatically segments and labels various components of the drill bit as per established criteria, generating comprehensive data vital for damage analysis. By employing this algorithm, videos of {PDC} drill bits can be processed with remarkable speed and accuracy. This represents a substantial advancement in data collection methods, with implications for improving the quality of bit damage assessment.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents the successful development and implementation of a wellbore quality scorecard which is used to evaluate wellbore quality using deterministic and probabilistic methods. This evaluation is based on analysing the real time data during the final trip out of hole with the drilling BHA.  The Wellbore Quality Scorecard is being used systematically across a large multi-asset drilling project where there was a history of problematic hole sections. Casing and liner running operations frequently encountered difficulties, and it was recognised that a system for evaluating the hole condition would help to improve operational decision making. The result of the evaluation is used to provide a better understanding of the condition of the wellbore that was drilled before committing to run casing or liner. Understanding the wellbore condition helps the team to decide, for example, whether to run a wiper trip to condition the wellbore or to save time and go ahead with casing or liner run.  The evaluation process is a collaboration between the remote collaboration centre, the rigsite team and the office-based operations team. A database is generated which records historical wellbore condition vs liner and casing running information which holds very useful technical insights about how each wellbore parameter quantitatively affects the wellbore quality.  The paper will describe how this process has now been applied to over 50 hole sections, and how it has improved decision making and the liner and casing running success rate.  A machine learning model has been developed which predicts the likelihood of successfully running the casing or liner to the target depth. This information is used to compliment the Wellbore Quality Score for informing operational decisions.}

	abstract		= {The use of Managed Pressure Drilling has widespread applications in the Permian Basin. In this basin, typically MPD is used in a more traditional and somewhat limited fashion. However, using MPD as a performance drilling technique is a relatively unexplored application and early results have yielded significant rate of penetration (ROP) increases and days shaved off wells.  While MPD has been used in this area for more traditional methods such as Early Kick Loss Detection and controlling inflows of over-pressured disposal zones, using MPD for performance drilling is a novel application in the area. Performance drilling is the act of reducing the typical, conventional mud weights, and supplementing the decrease in hydrostatic pressure with applied surface back pressure. This reduction in mud weight allows for cost savings in multiple areas, increases in ROP and an overall reduction in well construction costs.  CrownQuest wanted to implement MPD, for performance drilling, on deeper basin Wolfcamp wells (Wolfcamp D), where higher mud weights (12.5-13 ppg) were commonly being run. The well was planned for a 2.5 pounds per gallon (ppg) reduction in mud weight, compared to conventional. These wells drilled with reduced mud weights were compared with previously drilled Wolfcamp D wells in the same area. The results showed a 23.8\% increase in average ROP throughout the production hole section and an average of 5.85 days saved, with the implementation of MPD for performance drilling. Enabling a lighter mud system also seen a reduction in average lateral mud costs of 25\% related to building and maintaining the mud, as seepage losses were reduced and fewer weighting and supplementary materials were required for maintaining the active system. Lower mud weights reduce the ECD at the bit and reduce solids in the mud, which allowed for further changes and improvements to the drilling program. After MPD was implemented, these changes enabled the operator to complete a pace-setter, one-run build and lateral section with a intermediate drill out time to rig release (RR) of 5.3 days. Using MPD for performance drilling can save days per well, reduce costs, and improve overall ESG and well economics.  Wolfcamp wells that require heavier mud weights, and are considered more difficult to drill, than upper Wolfcamp formations can become more economical by implementing these performance drilling methods. These techniques to drill deeper Wolfcamp targets more economically could prove invaluable as prime acreage and shallower Wolfcamp targets are drilled and depleted.}

	abstract		= {Displacement to a dedicated screen running fluid (e.g. low-solids mud) is a common method to lower the solids loading of the fluid prior running the completion screens in order to minimize the risk of blockages. However, some advanced drill-in fluids exhibit excellent long-term stabilities under downhole conditions which allow for a dual use also as screen running fluid. A systematic selection of such a fluid for a horizontal well in an oilfield offshore Norway is presented.  Samples of different 1.2 SG oil-based drilling fluids and screen running fluid candidates were statically aged at 200 bar and 87 \textdegree{}C for 1 and 2 months. Complementarily characterization was performed by running viscometer sag shoe tests and laser particle size analysis of the samples. Actual core plugs of the reservoir section were selected for core flooding/formation damage tests covering different drill-in fluids and sequences including screen insertion with and without prior displacement to an actual screen running fluid. The return permeability and a detailed required draw-down analysis was performed.  Experiments have shown that the downhole stability is commonly underestimated when the surrounding pressure is lower than in the field like in a conventional aging cell. One of the drill-in fluids showed superior long-term stability with maintaining mobility even after 2 months of aging and no phase separation of significant settling. In contrast, the low-solids oil-based mud showed significant phase separation and some settling. Laboratory results were implemented to the flied by strict specification of the mud properties and verification by a comprehensive post-operational QA/QC of field samples in the laboratory.  The success was proven by no negative impact on productivity of the well compared to previously drilled and completed wells in the field. However, running the completion in DIF resulted in significant de-risking of drilling operations, cost savings and eliminated logistical challenges from previous wells.}

	abstract		= {Severe lost circulation occurs frequently in fractured and vugular media. When drilling fluid enters vugs or fractures, it experiences a temperature increase due to the reduced influence cooling from the wellbore and the growing influence of the higher in-situ formation temperature with invasion depth. This temperature increase can be exploited to help plug the vugs or fractures. If the lost fluid contains Thermally Activated Lost Circulation Materials (TALCMs), it experiences a strong temperature-induced increase in viscosity, making it effectively unpumpable and non-displaceable, thereby stopping further fluid losses. TALCMs can be employed as additives in drilling fluids, in dedicated treatment pills, or mixed with cement for dedicated squeezes.  TALCMs are a new type of temperature-tunable material that can be engineered to mitigate severe losses in a variety of geological formations with varying temperature gradients and depths. By exploiting the formation’s own temperature gradient, effective fracture or vugular sealing can be obtained, which opens up an entirely new way to mitigate severe losses in oil, gas, and geothermal wells, where lost circulation is a prime source of non-productive time.}

In alignment with a major operator's protocol in the Midland Basin, our approach focuses on mitigating bit damage and standardizing connection methods. A pivotal feature of this automation was its adaptability to different sequences and parameters without altering the software. After comprehensive testing on a drilling simulator, a field trial was initiated in the Midland Basin. Following positive feedback on the system's consistency and reliability, its use was expanded to three more rigs. The results revealed enhanced operator and rig contractor performance, especially in uniform connection performance and improved S2W and W2S durations. A collaborative relationship between product teams, operations, and the operator was essential in maximizing these benefits. Crucially, the collaboration between the operator and rig contractor was key to developing a quickly adopted, value-driven product.}

	abstract		= {It is known that the Stockhausen Effect, characterized as the accumulation of TVD error in directional wellbores resulting from the slide/rotate process employed with bent-housing mud motors, can have a significant impact on wellbore placement in the TVD plane. While much research has been conducted, and commercial solutions have been deployed to account for and correct these errors, all are focused on mud motor slide/rotate drilling. As contemporary drilling programs move to ever-increasing lateral lengths, utilization of Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS) is also trending upward. While potential advantages may exist in favor of RSS, like the elimination of slide drilling, it is important to consider that not all undesirable phenomena associated with slide drilling (well placement error, tortuosity, rugosity, high localized DLS, etc.) vanish from the wellbore. These characteristics are still present in the RSS wellbore and should be analyzed and quantified to ensure that wellbore quality metrics are consistent for all drilling methods.  To investigate cumulative TVD error in RSS wells, we developed a system to utilize the real time downhole steering data from RSS to populate a steering sheet that can be processed through an algorithm designed to account for TVD errors resulting from the Stockhausen effect. By capturing the RSS toolface and steering proportion in real time, we can determine at what intervals the RSS is actively steering and during what intervals it is drilling in a neutral, non-biasing mode. The result of cycling between steering and non-steering cycles creates a pattern similar to a slide/rotate sequence experienced when using steerable mud motors. This information allows us to construct a more accurate representation of the true trajectory of the wellbore than is provided by minimum curvature between the standard 95’ survey course lengths. In addition to uncovering TVD error this method also provides a higher resolution picture of various tortuosity metrics like borehole curvature and torsion.  We examined data from numerous wells across several basins to observe the TVD error generated by RSS steering mechanisms. It was concluded that these TVD errors should be considered for accurate wellbore positioning, and in addition revealed potential to enhance trajectory optimization capabilities of some Rotary Steerable Systems. In addition to uncovering TVD error, the high-resolution trajectory allows for a thorough examination of wellbore tortuosity, including localized DLS, and wellbore curvature and torsion to aid in identifying potential trouble zones in the lateral.}

	abstract		= {The continued application of physics-based limiter redesign workflow in the hard geothermal granite at the Utah FORGE project resulted in additional advances in hard rock practices and performance. The physics-based approach provided an effective framework to mitigate and address drill bit, geologic, trajectory, and downhole tool challenges and limitations. The advances were possible because the operating team was trained to understand how bit dysfunction and other non-bit limiters physically work, and had the knowledge required to mitigate these limiters in real-time or redesign to extend them when possible. In the final runs of the most recent well in the field, the ROP when rotating bent motors ranged from 150 ft/hr. to more than 300 ft/hr. and overall cumulative on-bottom rotating hours were reduced despite a more challenging, high angle well path with steering constraints.  The paper covers the workflows and practices used to:Extend the safe WOB and RPM limits of bits beyond the industry's common practices in granite (65-70K lbs. and 250 RPM on 9.5" bits)Continue to expand the industry's understanding of the application of clear water drilling fluids to mitigate low drill rates caused by dilatant strengthening (bottom hole balling)Drill with RSS in granite to achieve a smooth curve to 65\textdegree{} inclination.  Demonstrate practices for drilling a high angle tangent with a bent motor to achieve higher drill rates while still delivering borehole quality equaling or exceeding that of an RSS.  Evaluate practices to reduce the large decline in ROP observed in early footage with all bits in hard formations. This represents the largest opportunity for additional performance gains in geothermal drilling.  The paper incorporates both the specific practices implemented and the processes required to take a new operations team from initial project startup to record setting performance within the span of a single well (each FORGE well has been drilled by a different team). The authors’ intent in this and the previous paper, SPE 208798 (Dupriest and Noynaert, 2022), is to enable others to duplicate the gains at FORGE.}

	abstract		= {Drilling Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage SAGD wells requires placing the lateral section of the producer parallel to the lateral section of the steam injector and within a predefined distance to maximize production. After one well is drilled and completed, the second well is drilled using advanced wellbore positioning techniques to keep the two laterals at specific distance in close proximity to each other.  Active Magnetic Ranging is frequently used for positioning of SAGD wells, whereby an electromagnetic source, such as a solenoid is run on wireline in the first well that has been drilled and distance and direction measurements are made using the MWD tool while drilling in the second well. This increases the complexity of the operation as there is requirement to convey the source tool on wireline in a horizontal well and solutions for doing this, such as a tractor or coiled tubing, add considerable expense.  Passive Magnetic Ranging PMR is a common technique to estimate the distance and direction between the two wells while drilling the second well, without any requirement to run wireline tools in the offset wellbore. However, this technique requires taking at least 10 stationary surveys every stand if not more. This conventional practice leads to significant additional rig time and often increases directional drilling complexity from hole washouts to stuck pipe events. Additionally, as the wells are drilling into each other from opposite directions, both wells have high lateral and vertical uncertainty. The close proximity of both wells and the resultant external magnetic interference makes surveying an additional challenge to the BHA design and well integrity.  This is the first worldwide application of drilling SAGD twin wells utilizing Definitive Dynamic Surveys DDS to save two hours per stand by eliminating all the rig times taking stationary surveys every stand for PMR as well as eliminating all the risk to the drilling operation due to the prolonged time of having the drill string stationary. In addition, it is the first time to run a solid-state Gyroscopic Measurement While Drilling GMWD tool to measure the accurate wellbore position of the drilling well. This had significantly reduced the uncertainty of the estimated distance and direction between the two twinned wells.}

The method aims to break down upstream emissions to a process level, showing that emissions can be evaluated to a greater detail level compared to what current scope 3 reporting levels offer today. Results from a North Sea drilling case study conducted in collaboration with Noble Corporation are used for showcasing the impact burden levels, challenges and prosperity of accounting, reporting, and tracking upstream emissions as a drilling contractor. A framework tailored to the drilling industry is presented, emphasizing how upstream emissions may be linked to drilling and rig operational processes, and how these emissions can be continuously reported and improved over time. A set of system boundaries for assessing scope 3 emissions are suggested, along with recommended emission calculation methods. The presented framework may serve as an alternate supplement to IPIECA's adapted version of the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 Standard, otherwise intended for the petroleum industry, and to IADC's industry guideline for ESG reporting.}

	abstract		= {Occasionally, operations require setting a production liner on bottom. This could be unintentional, e.g. when the liner hanger slips fail to operate, or intentionally, e.g. when the liner is purposely run without a hanger to guarantee sufficient bypass area. A consequence of setting the liner on bottom is that the buckling force will be compressive, and assessment of the buckling severity is required to avoid high buckling induced dogleg severity (DLS). After the liner is cemented, the induced DLS is made permanent. Thus, this change in well path trajectory could jeopardize the runnability and installation of completion equipment.  In this study, the buckling induced DLS is estimated using a finite element based stiff-string model. The model takes in consideration the additional compressive loads of setting the liner top packer. It also accounts for liner centralization. It was found that this model overcomes the limitation of the theoretical models implemented in widely used commercial casing design software as it captures the physics of the buckled casing in between centralizers with more accuracy.}

	abstract		= {Offshore drilling rigs play a crucial role in global energy production, particularly in the extraction of oil and gas resources. However, the industry's environmental impact has raised concerns about the need for energy efficiency and decarbonization in offshore operations. This paper aims to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with improving energy efficiency and decarbonizing offshore drilling rigs.  The first part of the paper provides an overview of the Energy Trilemma (Sustainability, Security and Equity) followed by an introduction on the importance of data collection and analysis necessary to monitor energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions associated with offshore drilling rigs. It highlights the significant energy requirements for drilling and mobilization activities along with the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions contribute to climate change and environmental degradation, necessitating clear actions for reducing carbon footprints.  The paper highlights the economic and environmental benefits associated with energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the potential cost savings resulting from reduced energy consumption and the avoidance of carbon-related taxes or penalties. Furthermore, it reviews a 360-degree approach to Offshore Drilling Rig Decarbonization embedding it into operations, operator-contractor engagements, and technical advances. It also emphasizes the positive impact of such initiatives on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainability, and improving the industry's environmental stewardship.  Next, the paper discusses the potential strategies for enhancing energy efficiency on offshore drilling rigs. It examines advancements in optimized rig design, energy efficiency upgrades, energy storage systems and sustainable behavior enhancements. Additionally, it explores the adoption of low-carbon fuels and electrification of offshore rigs. The proven and expected benefits, challenges, and implementation considerations of these strategies are examined.  In conclusion, achieving energy efficiency and decarbonization on offshore drilling rigs is essential for addressing the Energy Trilemma while it is necessary that the drilling contractor and operator work closely together in operating the business in a way that meets economic, social, and environmental needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By embracing innovative technologies, optimizing operations, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, offshore drilling rigs can significantly reduce their carbon footprints while ensuring a sustainable and responsible future for the industry.}

Advanced buckling modeling, and a fundamental understanding of the effects of buckling, can be used to generate lighter well architectures, resulting in significant savings in cost and CO2e emissions, without compromising well integrity and zonal isolation.  The fundamental load regime, and associated assumptions, were analyzed to define the worst-case axial load that could be applied to the surface casing of the proposed lighter well architecture. Two different configurations of the surface casing string were modeled in engineering software using a stiff-string model with unique post-buckling capabilities. The identified load cases were simulated, and different sensitivities were performed, to refine the configuration of the surface casing. The detailed results (including von Mises stress, casing deformation, and axial displacement) were interpreted and combined with operational constraints to produce a final surface casing configuration that met all requirements.  The final configuration of the surface casing for the lighter well architecture was estimated to save the operator 5.1 days of operational time per well, generating savings in the region of \$4M USD and 1367klbm of CO2e per well. The operator decided to deploy the new architecture on six wells of their ongoing drilling campaign, two of which have already been successfully realized. With this success, the operator is looking to optimize the architecture further by refining some of the conservative load inputs, with measured data, to justify a reduction in the maximum expected load. The advanced buckling model revealed that the distance between centralizers and the radial clearance (created by the geometry of the centralizers) influences the bending stresses in the casing in a nonlinear way and that there is a sweet spot to be found, depending on the axial load. This discovery would have otherwise been missed if industry standard buckling equations were used. Understanding this allowed an informed decision to be made regarding the final configuration of the surface casing.  Understanding the limitations of industry-standard buckling formulae and their use with basic torque and drag modeling will make the practicing engineer aware of other methodologies and processes that can be applied to reimagine their well design.}

Interpreting this analysis is important to ensure that the well is hydraulically isolated from the surrounding environment before permanently sealing the well. However, this interpretation depends on a specialist's ability to analyze a large demand of data, which is complex and acquired through logging operations. This fact makes this process prone to errors, human dependence, and time-consuming. These three challenges motivated Ouronova, in partnership with Repsol Sinopec Brazil, to develop software to help interpret acoustic profiling. Also inspired by the objective of optimizing the Plugging and Abandonment operations completely, the software also optimizes the planning and management of Plugging and Abandonment campaigns. The so-called plug and abandonment (P\\\&A) Assistant software has proven to be a good tool that optimizes the Plugging and Abandonment process, using machine learning (ML) techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability and reduce the time for cement sheath integrity analysis. This paper then presents some supervised method techniques implemented in the software, such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. The results show that combining features derived from Cement Bond Log and Acoustic Impedance Log enables the construction of efficient models. The Gaussian model was the one with the best overall performance, achieving a Balanced Precise Accuracy equal to 0.50 and a Balanced Adjacency Accuracy around 0.88.}

	abstract		= {SPE's Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) sponsors the Drillbotics\textregistered{} autonomous drilling contest to promote advanced learning at participating universities. Two groups working independently employed similar engineering, software, and control technology to detect and mitigate drilling dysfunctions. Both teams demonstrated understanding of engineering requirements coupled with hands-on experience to successfully deploy their designs.  One team created a control model that connected with an industry research entity's well model that included a variety of formations and downhole pressures based on data from previously drilled wells in the North Sea. The well control simulation was new to the competition, and the team successfully created a workable system. The team drilled ahead at optimal ROP, stopping for connections. They then had to recognize an influx and determine whether this should be handled with the MPD system or stop drilling and close in on the kick. The model monitored surface flow in and flow out and pit level and compared readings with a trend analysis based on one-second data. The kick detection module included a technique to minimize false positives using a higher kick threshold, first giving a warning, and then switching from conventional drilling to MPD, and finally closing in the well if necessary. The simulated kick occurred during a connection and was a small kick at a low influx rate. It was detected when drilling, but later than desired. A retest with a lower kick threshold was more successful.  A second team designed and built a remotely operated autonomous small scale experimental rig that included a working version of an RSS tool to steer the BHA along a predefined trajectory within a block of sandstone. The control architecture enabled the distribution of various drilling tasks to independent specialized operating algorithms. Despite the limitations of a 1.5-inch wellbore, the physical rig team constructed and implemented an RSS with three pads actuated mechanically from the surface. Accompanied by an enhanced bit design and a length reduction of the BHA by over 50\% compared to the previous model, a build rate of 8 degrees was achieved in less than two feet measured depth. This effort resulted in the team's first successful application of the newly developed scaled RSS to autonomously drill a directional trajectory provided only minutes earlier. An externally applied electromagnetic field was used to measure the azimuth, while an accelerometer was used to measure the inclination to close the feedback loop for the steering algorithm.  Both teams had to solve common engineering problems, which may lead to the use of a physical rig to improve the fidelity of virtual models. Importantly, there is an increasing industry need to provide improved data interoperability, which is being met by this program. The achievements of both teams are important to the future of drilling automation, as they are first steps towards using these research tools to improve the creation of digital twins of full-scale rigs and to verify and validate interoperability of third-party apps prior to field release on land and offshore rigs.}

	abstract		= {Borehole quality is a crucial aspect of wellbore construction, impacting drilling and completion execution and long-term well reliability in terms of zonal isolation and casing integrity. However, developing key performance indicators and requirements for borehole quality has proven difficult since there are few direct measurements of borehole characteristics other than surveys.  This paper explores the use of ultra-high frequency acoustic borehole image logs and caliper measurements to develop methods to quantify effects during drilling operations, such as micro-tortuosity, salt creep, and other observed characteristics, which could prove useful in defining wellbore quality in the drilling phase. The role of the repeatable process of drilling a stand with different bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs as motorized rotary steerable systems (RSS) and conventional steerable systems (CSS) will be mapped to borehole quality impact with downhole measurements. Drilling operations and methods will be linked with the resulting borehole measurements and the relationship in terms of correlation and causality examined.  This case study documents the application of the processes and tools for vertical and lateral intervals of horizontal wells in the different basins of North America. Results of different states of drilling operations such as sliding, rotating, and reaming, drilling dysfunctions, BHA changes, drilling practices, and rock characteristics will be presented. The paper's conclusions use this approach to determine the needs and methods of wellbore quality measurement and requirements for drilling and completions and potential life of well implications.  This paper builds on the drilling mechanics process and downhole measurements to determine usable borehole quality key performance indicators that can be applied as additional wellbore quality management methods.}

	abstract		= {Operators in the Permian Basin have been performing two stage cementing operations on their casing strings for decades utilizing conventional diverter tool technology, often in combination with casing annulus packers.  Over time, issues with legacy diverter tools (DV) have been identified and solutions sought. These issues range from longer than desired time to drill-out the DV tool, reluctance to drill-out a DV tool with a directional assembly due to drill bit dulling and premature drilling motor/MWD failures, damage to the DV tool while drilling causing leaks and remediation, and an inability to pressure test the whole casing string after cementing. A development effort was made to eliminate these issues. The Hydraulic Port Collar (HPC) was designed and extensive qualification/testing of the HPC design was performed prior to field deployment. Running procedures were written and revised in consultation with a variety of operators. Several wells were identified for field trials. The wells were selected based on the operator’s desire to eliminate a DV tool drill-out. The wells had complex directional plans that required high bend drilling motors resulting in the operator’s reluctance to drill-out conventional DV tools with the curve BHA’s.  The hydraulic port collar functioned as designed on all field trials. Pressure readings from the cement trucks confirmed the tools opened within the calculated pressures and closed and sheared out within the calculated pressures. Full communication of compressed volume, from the float collar to surface was achieved, allowing the operator to perform a full string casing test. The wiper plug was mechanically confirmed as released from the HPC and subsequently pushed to bottom and drilled up when the shoe track was drilled out. Utilizing curve BHA’s with 2.12\textdegree{} to 2.38\textdegree{} bend motors, all wells were drilled and landed in the drilling window with one curve BHA run. As a result, dedicated DV tool drill-out runs were eliminated, no unusual damage or dulling of the curve BHA was observed and no post drill-out damage/leaks at the HPC were experienced. A review of the field trials showed efficiency gains up to 40\% when compared to previous operations where legacy DV tools had been deployed. These trials confirm that the novel Hydraulic Port Collar can increase operator efficiency in wells that require two stage cementing operations.  This paper will document case histories and lessons learn to date.}

As needs for advanced modeling and analytics have grown, this onshore drilling contractor embarked on a journey to centralize data acquisition, aggregation, transmission, and modeling into one platform located on-location.  This paper explains how the combination of both data exchange and modeling has allowed for the development of three novel controls applications that are combinations of traditional programming and industrial control logic. This opens doors to make advanced data science modeling, such as machine learning and online learning, available directly to existing rig control systems that do not have these capabilities.  The flexibility of this system offers significant opportunity for applying advanced analytics and data science tools at the rig site. Rig control systems are no longer limited by traditional industrial controllers but have the ability to interface with performance applications written in traditional programming languages. Applications running on our edge servers, integrated as input/output to the control systems, removes the limitations of the PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and allows us to ``modernize'' our control system without having to replace existing PLCs.}

	abstract		= {We present a case study on the utilization of a machine learning (ML)-based computational tool for detecting stuck pipe risks early in live operations. The system was used in two Gulf of Mexico (GoM) wildcat exploration wells. The risk detection approach is based on a novel technology using physics-informed machine learning models to analyze real-time data and detect potential stuck pipe incidents in live operations. The ML models were pre-trained on a variety of wells from different fields. The system was designed for out-of-the-box usage, which supports operational monitoring for exploration wells without pre-training on offset well data. The methodology and the process of integrating the computational tool into live operations, and the flow of data between the tool and the drilling operation is described. Additionally, the paper delves into drilling practices that helped to prevent stuck pipe and examine specific incidents that were unavoidable.  The application ran stably throughout the operations, with high uptime and few false warnings in both wells; on average, fewer than one false alert was observed per day of operations. The pre-trained models proved effective, requiring no additional training; this generalizability is an important prerequisite for utility when applied to exploration wells, where offset data may be unavailable. However, due to lack of personnel to follow up the system's outputs in real-time, the benefits were limited. The first well was drilled without stuck pipe incidents. Some sticking risk symptoms were identified during the operation, especially in a fault zone. The post-well analysis indicates that good drilling practices were enough to mitigate the risks. The drilling practices responsible for the success of the operation will be discussed. In the second well, there were stuck pipe incidents. The application provided some indications of stuck symptoms but with some limitations for how far in advance the risk could be detected. The causes of the stuck incidents, the challenges in avoiding them, and updates to the risk detection system for identifying these, will be explored. Based on the experience described in the paper, the authors will offer recommendations for optimal technology utilization both from the application's and organizational perspectives.}

	abstract		= {At times during the lifetime of an oilfield well, there is a need to establish or rectify a barrier by using the perforation-wash-cement (P/W/C) remedial procedure. Evaluation of the P/W/C interval is carried out by sonic and ultrasonic logging tools. Depending on perforation hole size in the casing the bond log quality can be affected, rendering the logging results invalid or qualitative only. Knowledge gathered in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has allowed for improvement in techniques and data processing workflow for the P/W/C procedure.  The toolstring is reconfigured to acquire data at the highest resolution possible across an optimized logging interval. Originally, the procedure was standard cement evaluation, but through experience, the logging and data processing methodology has been improved to better accommodate the challenges posed by the P/W/C environment. Acoustic impedance images are processed with an advanced methodology widely used for open hole geological images. It applies linear feature reconstruction (inpainting) and a texture reconstruction algorithm in a multipoint statistical approach to predict data behavior in the perforation-affected interval. Different processing options are available, allowing comparison to select the most representative result.  Behind the casing, cleanup efficiency depends on many parameters, including perforation design. The log data quality is greatly influenced by the density of the perforation shots, the entrance hole size, and perforation pattern. To evaluate the cement, a centralized toolstring, speed-corrected depth, and high-resolution datasets contribute to obtaining a highly detailed cement map of the annular conditions across the P/W/C intervals. This allows the implementation of further processing to strengthen the possibility of accurately reconstructing the acoustic impedance maps to provide the operator with an informed evaluation of the cement status. In multiple cases, the bond quality of the annular contents prior to the P/W/C operation have been logged to establish a baseline and make a proper pre- and post-evaluation, and such logging is recommended. In addition, blank sections due to gun connections across the perforated intervals allow an additional check to the overall log quality.  Lessons learned from P/W/C logging were shared in the NCS across multiple operators and globally.}

	abstract		= {In oil wells, operators must prove the presence of a barrier behind multiple casings, which is expensive as they need to remove pipes and evaluate a single casing. To reduce cost and carbon emissions, we implemented a solution that involved logging through tubing to evaluate both the condition behind the tubing and the barrier behind the second pipe, while satisfying NORSOK D-10 guidelines for single-casing evaluation.  A combination of ultrasonic and sonic tools was deployed within the tubing. The ultrasonic measurements provide detailed understanding of the annular content behind/around the tubing versus depth along with position of tubing in the casing. The sonic measurements, with lower frequencies, have a greater depth of investigation and thereby evaluate the presence of any solids behind the second pipe. Extensive modeling and laboratory experiments of dual-string configurations in our research facility along with multiple sets of field data helped determination of the presence of solids using both ultrasonic and sonic measurements.  Two wells, a water injector, and an oil producer, were intervened via intervention tower in the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). For the injector well (7-in. tubing and 9 5/8-in. casing), dual-string evaluation results were compared with the first bond log along with extended leakoff test. For the producer well (5 1/2-in. tubing and 9 5/8-in. casing), dual-string evaluation results were compared against a single-casing validation log. The validation log provides a strong degree of confidence in the dual-string evaluation results. Data from the dual-string evaluation and single-casing log will be used to generate a machine learning model for this well geometry, fluids, cement, and formation and is expected to give another high-resolution azimuthal prediction, which would allow for even higher confidence in the answers in later operations with the possible elimination of the need for a validation log.  This paper discusses an offshore case study where the technology was used in two wells in the NCS. The results and observations with dual-string logging technology will be presented in addition to the validation result after pulling the inner tubing. These dual-string log measurements were then used to streamline the sidetracking program, resulting in cost saving due to offline rig activity and minimizing contingency operation, rig time, and scope while reducing overall carbon emissions.}

This paper provides an overview of how cross-industry application of machine learning (ML) technology helped solve challenges related to real-time pattern recognition of breakover and how this solution assisted with providing immediate metrics and control of the drilling process.  This project leveraged Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), used frequently in other industries for speech recognition and pattern recognition over time series data, to create a statistical classifier that detects drillstring breakover in real time. Although these techniques have not seen widespread adoption in the oil and gas industry, they provide a flexible solution to many automation problems. Model features correlated with string stiffness were constructed that allowed for accurate classification of pre-breakover and post-breakover states. Subject matter experts were enlisted to label 500+ examples of breakover, which were used to train and test models for both ascending and descending drillstrings. The models were then deployed and integrated into the drilling control system to provide monitoring capabilities and control certain processes.  The models provided accurate detections of breakover more than 90\% of the time when measured against several wells studied for this project and provided hookload values for both breakover and general pickup and slackoff operations. This high accuracy allows for broad application of the model to several use cases. Applications include reducing an operator's 20-ft standard pickup distance, thereby reducing overall connection times, and using the associated models improved the quality of tares in deep lateral sections. The model also provided additional benefits, including automated drag monitoring for rotary drilling and tripping as well as hole condition monitoring during cleanup cycles. Both offer opportunities to optimize flat time and will be discussed in detail.}

	abstract		= {Wellbore instabilities and mud losses lead to costly and time-consuming drilling issues. The identification of these drilling risks is inevitable when it comes to estimating time, costs, and the success of wellbores for exploration and production in reservoirs. The goal of this study is to assess drilling integrity and enhance drilling program designs for forthcoming wells in the reservoir located in the Matach\'{\i}n Field, Colombia based on a high-resolution 4D geomechanical model and incorporated natural fractures. The study involves examining the prediction of natural fractures and stability of wellbores during production scenarios, with the aim of minimizing non-productive time in future wells, irrespective of their trajectories.  An advanced geomechanical workflow was developed in four stages. The first stage involved gathering all data through a screening process. The second stage was data integration, which involved constructing a structural model by incorporating geological attributes and single well profiles, including geomechanical parameters, stress distributions, and pore pressure. In the third stage, present-day stresses were analysed, and their evolution was examined due to changes in pore pressure from the reservoir model and imposed tectonic strains. The fourth stage involved analysing stresses, elastic and rock strength properties for field integrity, drilling integrity, discontinuity stability analysis, and optimal well placement ultimately incorporating natural fractures. Geomechanical properties and stresses were derived from wireline logs at well scale and calibrated against available measurements, such as rock core tests, formation tests, and wellbore deformation analysis. Dynamic pore pressure data up to present-day were included to assess stress changes caused by depletion. The results of 1D geomechanical analysis were upscaled into {3D} and incorporated into a complex structural grid along with fault and discrete fracture network models.  The {3D} model shows that well trajectories can be improved for increased wellbore stability, resulting in a significant decrease in predicted wellbore collapses. Pore pressure changes that occur due to depletion (production) are explicitly reflected in the reservoir section. As one of the first {3D} geomechanical studies in the Colombian Matach\'{\i}n field, the model provides a robust subsurface stress distribution that allows conclusions on safe and optimal well placement. The {3D} model serves as the basis for future studies to incorporate new information available from well data and laboratory data. New geological and seismic interpretations allow for an extension of the model area to yet unexplored regions.}

	abstract		= {Drilling operations in the US Permian Basin shale play with a new 4-\textthreequarters{}" Rotary-Steerable Drilling System (RSS) revealed that with high Rates Of Penetration (ROP), high Weight On Bit (WOB) (and other drilling parameters) encountering stringers or interbedded formations can lead to unwanted effects. The Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) can be deflected before the steering unit with its steering pads can counteract the deflection. This can lead to deviations from the directional plan and High Local Doglegs (HLD) when drilling in the horizontal/lateral section, which can have a negative impact on the electronics within the steering unit.  As a countermeasure, a combination of a pin-down connection steering unit with a short box-up connection drill bit, or Integrated Bit (IB), was developed. This combination allows a much shorter bit to steering pad distance. Due to the shorter bit-to-pad-distance an improved steering response is expected resulting in fewer high local dogleg occurrences. The integrated box-up bit basically moves the drive-shaft pin-down connection into the drill bit. The remaining bit shank is very short requiring modifications to the make-up and break-out procedure.  Results from the data acquired in the Permian Basin shale play yielded promising results in terms of steering accuracy. When comparing bending cycle load vs. local Dogleg Severity (DLS), local DLS are typically lower and have less bending cycles drilling through these critical local DLS when IB were deployed. The overall average ROP of runs with IB is higher than the overall average ROP of runs with standard bits.  The amount of data collected for this study allows a good statistical approach for comparison of the performance of a standard drilling BHA and bit versus a BHA featuring an IB. It proves that by further reducing the distance between the first formation contact point at the drill bit to the second contact point at the steering unit there is an overall improvement in performance and wellbore placement. This provides opportunities for incremental future optimization of the drill bit and BHA system.}

	abstract		= {Targeting deep reach laterals in vibration prone interbedded abrasive sandstones requires multiple bits to complete the prolific pay zones in Central USA. Excessive cutter wear coupled with extreme torque fluctuation in such targets results in reduced ROP and premature failure of BHA components. Early POOH leads to 24 to 48 hours of non-productive time due to BHA tripping. This puts huge economic risk on such challenging pay zones. This study exhibits detailed analysis of downhole and in-bit sensing data to increase the operational stability window enabling enhanced bit durability and smoother drilling conditions for economic drilling of long laterals.  The proposed bit's operation optimization framework is built using a detailed analysis for an in-bit high-frequency sensing gyro and accelerometers data correlated to the geo-steering unit vibrational and Gamma-ray data. The data analysis identified High-Frequency Torsional Oscillation (HFTO) prone formations and HFTO event frequencies, amplitudes and durations while drilling through lithologies with different rock strengths. The findings from the analysis of the field data are cross referenced to the bit response in lab experiments using in-bit sensing while drilling custom built rock cores under high confinement pressure. The result of this work is used to accurately model the drill bit performance to develop best practices to operate them. An operational stability map and a drilling guideline were built and communicated with the region for longer reach and stable drilling.  The data analysis showed a correlation between the lithology shaleness factor and the bits susceptibility to trigger HFTO among other vibrational events. The higher the shale content on the GR track the lower the HFTO excitation probability. These findings were mirrored in the lab while drilling interbedded cores at high confining pressure and it was used to calibrate our drilling models for bit optimization. The application of the drilling guidelines on operating 9 bits resulted in a total savings of \$500K per well and 4 days less of non-productive tripping. The guided drilling practices increased the drilled footage per bit by 50\%, while reaching the same dull state as previous runs. The control of the bit HFTO and vibrational response decreased the frequency of premature BHA equipment failure enabling longer intervals and less unnecessary tripping.  The absence of wire line logging in long reach laterals limits the understanding of targeted zones. This framework enables gaining deeper formation insights that unlock the optimization of capable drill bits. The adoption of such practice is promising longer footage per bit, less downhole vibrational issues, and economic completion of challenging interbedded abrasive across the world.}

	abstract		= {High-frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a particularly damaging vibration phenomenon that occurs while drilling HFTO-prone rocks with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact ({PDC}) bits and aggressive drilling parameters. Mitigation or load reduction strategies are based on weight on bit or bit rotary speed reduction and are associated with lower rate of penetration and therefore limit the drilling efficiency. This paper discusses the suppression of HFTO with a 4.75-inch tool size damper assembly that is placed above the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and typically below the mud motor. The efficiency of the damper assembly is discussed in a case study with more than 40 runs in Permian Basin targeting different applications, environments, and formations, giving further evidence that providing damping to the BHA can completely mitigate HFTO.  The damper tool is designed for the purpose of mitigating HFTO. Inputs for the design of the inertia-based damper elements are the required damping identified from high-frequency downhole measurement data, laboratory testing and modeling to analyze and optimize the damping principle incorporated in the tool, and numerical simulations to analyze the achievable damping in different BHAs. The tool design is robust as proven in a standard process of tool reliability tests including rotating bending, vibration, temperature, and pressure, and not limiting the drilling parameters. The deployment is preceded by a step that maximizes achievable damping in the deployed BHA enabled by an optimization algorithm and numerical modeling. Herein, the damper elements are optimally placed for the identified critical modes of HFTO, targeting a placement in antinodes of the mode shapes with high vibration amplitudes guaranteeing a high damping effect.  The case study incorporates more than 40 runs in NAL showing that the occurrence of HFTO is reduced significantly in different applications. The case study includes back-to-back runs with similar BHAs with and without the damper assembly in different HFTO prone applications proving the efficiency of the tool in mitigating HFTO. Consecutive runs in the same well and formation using other vibration mitigation tools show a significantly higher HFTO-suppression rate with the damper assembly. The overall performance gain by use of the damper is further proven by a statistical evaluation and in comparison to the second and third best performing vibration mitigation tool, showing significant increase in all relevant performance metrics, including, but not limited to, Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) and Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). BHAs with the new damper tools outperform BHAs with industries currently preferred commercial vibration mitigation tools by as much as +100\% in MDBF and +100\% in MTBF.  The case study shows that HFTO can be mitigated by use of the new 4.75-inch damper assembly. The damaging HFTO that held back the drilling parameters is suppressed which enables a step change in drilling efficiency and reliability, which ultimately leads to a significant decrease in drilling cost.}

	abstract		= {Drilling optimization is a complicated multi-objective processing optimization problem. During drilling, drillers need to adjust WOB and RPM continuously in a timely manner, not only to maximize ROP, but also to prevent severe vibration and maintain downhole tool durability. In this study, a virtual drilling agent using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model is developed and trained to automatically make drilling decisions and proven to effectively optimize drilling parameters.  A deep RL model using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is developed to optimize drilling process. In RL model, the reward of drilling decisions at each drilling step is a function of drilling ROP, downhole vibration tendency, bit dull state, and risks of tool failure. Separate modules to evaluate the reward of each component are implemented and trained using field and laboratory data. Deep RL model is applied and tested comprehensively on different drilling environments including hard and abrasive rock, embedded rock, vibrational vs. stable drilling. The hyper-parameters of the actor-critic NN architecture in RL model are carefully selected to improve the model convergence.  Results show the deep RL model can effectively find the optimum drilling solutions in various drilling environments. In soft formation, RL model applies the upper limit of WOB and RPM throughout the drilling depth to maximum ROP and reduce drilling time. In hard and abrasive formation, RL model gradually changes RPM and WOB to prevent the pre-mature wear of {PDC} cutters. The change of the drilling parameters is optimized based on rock abrasivity and target drilling depth. In unstable drilling environment, while RL model limits the ratio of WOB and RPM to avoid stick-slip vibration, simultaneously, the WOB and RPM is controlled to maximum ROP to drill to TD. In embedded formation, RL model successfully found the optimum solution by adjusting WOB/RPM to avoid stick-slip and overloading of bit cutting structure. The learning process of RL model shows hyper-parameter selection plays a critical role in model convergence and accuracy. Improperly selected hyper-parameter in RL model can lead to the failure of solution searching or sub-optimum solution. Overall, the RL model is approved to effectively find optimum drilling solutions in the various drilling environments and can be applied for both pre-well drilling planning and real-time drilling optimization.  To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop deep RL model for drilling optimization by implementing a combination of ROP, vibration, bit dull, and durability in the reward function. The proposed RL model can be extended to include more reward factors in the drilling optimization such as whirl and high frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO), stuck pipe, tool temperature and so on. The RL model can be applied for both pre-well drilling planning and real-time drilling optimization.}

	abstract		= {A well intercept operation has the scope to drill into an existing well. Similarly, some infill drilling operations are conducted with the scope of avoiding interception with other wells. A prototype of a tool for Active Magnetic Ranging While Drilling (AMR) without the use of a separate wireline operation has been developed. The main scope of the current article is presenting the results of a series of prototype tests of this tool in test wells.  The ranging tool emits a low frequency alternating current into the formation to reach the target well, and then run through that well's casings and back to the well being drilled. This electric current set up a variable magnetic field that is measured by the AMR tool determining the direction towards the target well as well as the distance.  In case of drilling a relief well, 10 - 25 wireline runs are needed before the target well is intercepted. The present AMR tool is fully integrated in the drill pipe and, thus, no wireline operations are required, and all the tripping operations are avoided.  A prototype of an active magnetic ranging tool on the drill pipe has been developed. This tool is outlined in the paper. Most focus will be given to a performance test conducted in a research well in Norway. Different pipes with controlled earthing are placed in neighbour wells to the well with the logging tool. The AMR tool was run in one of the research wells and the direction and distances to other target wells were measured. The set-up and the results of this logging operation that was conducted on the drill pipe is described in detail. It is described how the direction and distance between the two wells are measured using the tool.}

	abstract		= {In this paper, we introduce innovative laboratory equipment, the high-temperature, high-pressure sag cell (HTHP-SC), designed specifically to measure the static settling of weight material under actual downhole conditions. high-pressure testing to assess drilling fluids’ weight-material suspension is not new in the drilling fluids industry. However, the HTHP-SC is an advancement in the field of drilling fluid testing equipment because its design improves measurement accuracy, and because it is compatible with current cementing consistometers and curing chambers. This compatibility enhances its utility for evaluating drilling fluid performance, especially high-performance invert emulsion fluids under field pressure and temperature regimes.  Accurate measurement and thorough fluid property evaluation are of paramount importance to customize the design of the drilling fluids to ensure their performance under particular drilling envelopes. Therefore, simulating actual downhole conditions in the laboratory becomes instrumental in improving the prediction accuracy of fluid performance under actual drilling scenarios. This approach is invaluable as it enables a better understanding of the dynamics involved, helping to optimize drilling fluid properties and additives for improved outcomes.  It is established that the types of additives used to formulate drilling fluids and the resulting fluid properties play a decisive role in weight-material sag performance of invert emulsion fluids. Failing to recognize this could result in a flawed fluid design, and ineffective fluid treatments during drilling operations that could potentially lead to fluid issues, impairing, in turn, the drilling performance. For this reason, a comparative analysis of low-pressure and high-pressure tests conducted up to a 7-day period is presented in this paper. The results demonstrate that low-pressure density measurements can greatly exaggerate settling compared to testing at actual well pressures and bottomhole temperatures, a behavior already recognized in the drilling fluids industry. However, with the attempt to shed more clarity on the reason for these measurements, we show in this paper that these significant differences in density measurements cannot simply be related to an increase in fluid viscosity caused by higher pressure, or a lesser expansion of the base oil, but principally to the type of rheology modifiers used. This insight is essential for selecting the appropriate chemistry for the rheology modifier(s) to achieve the desired fluid performance, based upon the drilling conditions, and to avoid overtreatments with these additives, which could lead to higher than desired equivalent circulating densities (ECD), surge and swab pressures, and pressures to break circulation. Furthermore, we present and discuss the dynamic sag performance of the fluids tested and compare it with the static performance.  In conclusion, we present low-pressure static and dynamic sag measurements, and high-pressure static results using a newly designed piece of laboratory equipment aiming to contribute to the understanding of weight-material sag under static and dynamic conditions when varying the type of rheological modifiers. We observed that the choice of rheology modifier is crucial for static sag behavior, with less distinct effects on dynamic sag tendencies. A combination of a clay-based modifier and an organoclay-based additive showed superior performance compared to fluids containing a copolymer latex and a polyamide. The findings from this study attempt to improve operational efficiency and safety in drilling operations. The HTHP-SC represents a step forward in the quest for an accurate assessment of the static weight-material sag potential, particularly in the context of high-performance invert emulsion fluids (HPIEF), or the so-called low-ECD fluids.}

	abstract		= {Standardizing well plans by utilizing Standard Practices (SPs) in the digital tools Program Builder (PrB) and Rig Site Execution (RSE) increases the competitiveness of wells operations. The process improves collaboration both within operators and with vendors, enables digitalization of data and workflows, and accelerates experiential learnings to produce more predictable outcomes. SPs are phase- or task-level operational procedures written by Franchise (Standardization) Engineers that are rig, well, and vendor agnostic which are made up of activities with operations codes, checks, and steps. SPs are categorized by Preliminary Well Designs (PWDs), and the Well Planning Report allows for definition of the sequence of SPs required for the operational plan given the PWD assigned to the well.  Once the program is initiated in PrB, the Engineer can add well, vendor, and rig specific details to the operational plan which was auto generated from SPs. The Engineer invites other collaborators, whether within the same company or a third-party, into the tool to contribute. When the draft program is ready, a review process is facilitated within PrB, and the program is assured. Next, the operational plan becomes the foundation of the work instructions, which the Supervisor owns. They enrich the program to transform it into a worksite-ready document for the wellsite staff. All edits made to the SPs are captured and become the basis of a feedback loop to continuously improve SPs. These performance improvements will naturally cascade through wells globally.  Use of Program Builder has already been demonstrated in Operations. The program was created by the Design Engineer within three weeks and was deployed to the worksite. Initial feedback from the field was strong, resulting in the decision to continue the process through work instructions. The tool was found to improve operational efficiency and drive full transparency between the office and the worksite.  Standardizing and simplifying programs reduces the administrative burden on the Engineer, allowing them to focus on higher-value aspects of the planning, and presents a single source of truth for the entire well execution process. Deriving the work instructions from the program ensures that the procedural guidance defined by Franchise through SPs is followed all the way to the worksite, leading to predictable outcomes and competitive well delivery.}

Expanding access to the internet using portable devices with high computing power has transformed the way people learn globally. This research collects and expands on work done recently by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) to advance the use of technology in well control training and competency retention. Experiences over the past five years illustrate that the necessity of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated acceptance for hybrid (combined remote and in-person) learning methodologies in the oil and gas industry. Studies into gamification over the past two decades show it has a statistically significant positive effect on cognitive, motivational and attitudinal aspects of adult learning. Synergized learning combining remote and in-person education with gamified learning systems present an opportunity to improve competency development and sustainment. Applying these learnings to develop both existing and new computer-based aspects of well control training and competency sustainment programs could improve well control competencies across the industry, thus enhancing performance in the critical process safety activities of upstream oil and gas operations. This paper summarizes two industry reports on these topics, presents detailed analytical findings of academic research into gamification, and recommends how to implement hybrid learning and gamification strategies to improve vital well control training and competency sustainment for the oil and gas workforce.}

	abstract		= {Nowadays, complex {3D} trajectories are handled with a succession of circular arcs. Although they have constant curvature, their toolface is not constant. Consequently, directional drillers must adjust the toolface regularly to reach the target entry within its tolerances. This paper investigates the use of the constant curvature and constant toolface curve (CTC in short) as an alternative to the circular arc to facilitate the directional drilling work to reach the target entry within its boundaries.  The problem is addressed by calculating a safe operating envelope (SOE) to reach the boundaries of the target entry. The target entry tolerance is discretized as a polygon. From the current bit position and its direction, the possible choices of curvatures and toolfaces are obtained in order to reach the edges of the target entry shape. The SOE can be calculated with the circular arc or with the CTC curve. It is, therefore, possible to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both types of curves to attain the target entry and stay within its boundaries.  The circular arc is shorter than the CTC curve. However, it requires adjusting the toolface during the navigation, which is not the case with the CTC curve. As a result, the directional driller can easily control the bottom hole assembly (BHA) direction such that the well lands within the target entry limits by using set-points for toolface and curvature inside the calculated SOE. Furthermore, a new way to represent the SOE is introduced. It makes use of a {3D} cylindrical representation where the curvature is mapped as the height of a cylinder, while the toolface corresponds to the azimuth in the cylindrical coordinate system, and the length is linked to the radial distance. This provides a visual aid to understand the SOE. Moreover, this visualization helps to appreciate the relationship of the initial bit location and direction in the construction of the SOE and how the margins increase in a particular manner as the bit approaches the target entry polygon.  The CTC curve is the natural one followed by directional positive displacement motors (PDM) or rotary steerable systems (RSS). Potentially, the CTC curve may be a door-opening solution to automated directional drilling control as it is easier to be followed by both PDM and RSS.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents development of a system to test the origins of high-frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) and identify the physical cause that allow for building information, which will alleviate this damaging dysfunction.  It will present field data where the actual amplitude of HFTO is a complex function of many parameters in which both drill-bit speed and weight on the bit are extremely significant. The HFTO amplitude will increase with both parameters to a peak and then a further increase will reduce the actual vibration.  To characterize these relations, a facility was built in our Research Centre in Cambridge, UK, to test HFTO in a laboratory environment. A torsional equivalent to a mass spring resonator was used. The facility allows for drilling under identical drilling conditions with HFTO enabled or disabled.  It will be shown that the origin of HFTO is at the actual cutting structure contact with the formation. The HFTO is not driven by the broadband bit drilling noise but by the actual bit cutter's interaction with the formation rock. It is these interactions that drive the speed and weight on bit (WOB) characteristics observed in downhole operations.  The characteristics and scale of the dysfunction are dependent upon the formation, the cutting structure, as well as the cutter profiles. This new knowledge will enable bits to be built that will alleviate HFTO rather than drive it.}

	abstract		= {This study investigates the profitability of early sign detection of stuck pipes by considering the trade-off between reducing nonproductive time (NPT) through detection and increasing NPT through false alarms. Our objectives are to propose a hybrid approach combining physics-based knowledge and data science, analyze the timing of false alarms, improve the model to minimize false alarms, and evaluate profitability by quantifying NPT reduction.  Our proposed detection method combines physics-based knowledge and data science techniques, specifically capturing torque and standpipe pressure increases. First, we enhance the method by refining the model equation, learning method, and anomaly calculation method. Second, using field data from multiple wells collected over several months, we analyze the timing of false alarms and further refine the model to reduce them. Finally, to evaluate the profitability of our method, we examine the frequency of stuck incidents, NPT owing to stuck incidents, and NPT owing to false positives, and then quantify the reduction in NPT, considering both true-positive and false-positive rates.  By applying our method to 11 wells, we generated approximately 130 days of stuck risk output. By determining a threshold that detects 40\% of the stuck signs, we identified 37 false alarms. Analysis of these false positives revealed that nine could potentially indicate stuck signs, 23 could be disregarded by the operator or filtered out through data preprocessing, and five persist as challenging cases for the current method. Based on these findings, we further enhanced the model to reduce false alarms and successfully reduced the count to 11. In addition, our profitability calculation, based on NPT and considering the trade-off between true positives and false positives, demonstrates the potential for a reduction of several hours per year. Furthermore, implementing stuck sign detection is expected to lead to cost savings associated with bottom hole assembly losses, fishing, and sidetrack operations.  The novelty of our research lies in evaluating the profitability of early stuck sign detection by analyzing false alarms using multiple wells and long-term data. This analysis enables us to enhance the detection model and demonstrate the profitability of the proposed hybrid approach. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering both the true-positive and false-positive rates to enhance and evaluate the performance of early stuck sign detection methods.}

	abstract		= {Measuring the values of weight on bit (WOB) and differential pressure (DiffP) through accurate taring is critical for ensuring downhole tool health and creating accurate parameter roadmaps for drilling optimization. Current industry standards for taring rely on the driller to manually select a particular time when these values are zero, which is often imprecise and/or inaccurate. This paper will detail the journey this drilling contractor made to automate the taring process as part of a broader connection automation initiative, how initial solutions challenged organizational assumptions on downhole behaviors, and how a pattern recognition algorithm allowed for better tare consistency and accuracy over existing field procedures.  An initial process automation procedure was designed and implemented in the rig control system (RCS) to manage the connection process, starting with coming out of slips and ending with tagging bottom. As part of this process, the system included a step to consistently tare when the drill bit is one foot off bottom and descending at a constant rate. During field trials, this method gave encouraging results over previous manual tares. Though the result did show improvement over the traditional manual taring method, discrepancies in the relationship between WOB and DiffP eventually led to an improved method of taring which utilizes a novel pattern recognition algorithm. This algorithm detects when the bit tags bottom and establishes a reference hookload (HKLD) at that point. A pattern recognition algorithm was included into the automation sequence replacing the step to tare one foot from bottom.  The initial process automation routine provided consistency to the taring process which was observed during testing. The improvement in consistency revealed inconsistency in WOB tares which was supported by variance in DiffP when WOB was constant. A pattern recognition method was developed to identify when tagging bottom. This algorithm was applied to historical data providing evidence of its benefit to WOB tares. The algorithm was included in an application and then adapted and applied to DiffP tares. The application was run over a historical dataset to qualify its viability. After proving viability, it was exchanged with the taring step in the initial process automation routine and run on live wells. Taring using the pattern-recognition based application presented better results than the manual and initial automation taring methods. The overall operational impacts of each method will be discussed in further detail.  The results of this project challenge underlying assumptions about how taring should be performed and improves overall understanding of the impact of different automation routines. The pattern recognition method discussed in this paper constitutes a novel application which utilizes new technology to improve existing processes.}

	abstract		= {As part of the global effort to decrease emissions through the use of alternative fuels, the first ever use of hydrogen fuel in a dual-fuel engine on a drilling rig was successfully demonstrated in the Appalachian region. The process of safely managing hydrogen on site is described along with the effects on engine emissions and performance.  Prior to the in-field demonstration, initial testing was performed in a controlled environment to simulate the site conditions and confirm engineering modeling of combustion characteristics. The demonstration consisted of initial testing at 5\% hydrogen concentration and concluded with testing at 20\% hydrogen. New safety requirements were established with regards to how hydrogen was managed on site. No changes to the drilling program were made in order to validate performance using real-world conditions. The hydrogen was blended into compressed natural gas (CNG) on-site, which provided flexibility to adjust the properties of the fuel mix.  The demonstration successfully proved that the existing dual-fuel engines can support a blend of up to 20\% hydrogen without requiring any additional engine development, adjustments to the rig's control system, or hardware modifications. Transient re sponse of the engine was not compromised during load steps, load sheds, or gas shutoffs, even with the maximum hydrogen concentration. Aggressive engine substitution rates were maintained and a negligible change in engine efficiency was observed. Reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were observed to be directly correlated to the concentration of hydrogen in the fuel mixture. Although existing infrastructure needs to grow before hydrogen becomes an economically viable fuel for drilling applications, significant investment in the hydrogen industry indicates a future where hydrogen is a widely adopted source of energy. This demonstration represents an important first step to prepare for the hydrogen economy of the future.}

	abstract		= {Accurate real-time modeling of downhole temperature (DHT) in high-temperature geothermal wells is crucial for proactive temperature management and preventing thermally induced drilling issues. While existing numerical models excel at precise DHT prediction, their complexity and long computational times render them unsuitable for real-time operations. This study introduces an innovative machine-learning model that overcomes these limitations, enabling real-time DHT monitoring in geothermal wells.  To create a robust dataset simulating DHT behavior under various drilling conditions in FORGE wells, we leveraged a sophisticated thermo-hydraulic model validated with Utah FORGE field data. This dataset, comprising thousands of data points, served as the training ground for a Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM) model. The DLSTM model, designed to capture the intricate non-linear relationship between DHT and drilling parameters, was fine-tuned using a Bayesian algorithm that efficiently optimized model settings based on past evaluation results. In a comprehensive evaluation, the model was rigorously tested against previously unseen scenarios to assess its strengths and limitations. Additionally, a parametric analysis was conducted to validate the model's predictions against established temperature management techniques reported in the literature.  Key findings indicate that variables such as DHT from previous time steps, mud type, and wellbore horizontal lateral length play pivotal roles in DHT estimation. The developed DLSTM model exhibits exceptional precision, stability, and generalizability in predicting DHT during both circulation and pump-off (no circulation) scenarios. Its architecture, featuring two LSTM layers with numerous cells, augmented by an additional hidden layer of artificial neural networks, effectively mitigates overfitting issues commonly encountered with conventional neural networks when dealing with extensive time-series drilling data. Across all scenarios, the model utilizes a 3-minute lag time of time series data to accurately simulate DHT in geothermal wells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) consistently below 1\textdegree{}C in most cases. Notably, the DLSTM model successfully captures the dynamic behavior of bottomhole circulating temperature (BHCT) and DHT build-up during pump shut-off periods in various drilling scenarios. Furthermore, the model's predictions regarding the impact of various cooling strategies on downhole temperature align well with the established understanding of temperature management techniques in geothermal wells.  Our developed machine learning model offers a reliable and automated solution for DHT prediction and real-time heat management in geothermal wells. It serves as a practical and significantly faster alternative to complex, time-consuming physics-based models. This research underscores the DLSTM's potential for capturing intricate time-dependent relationships between input features (drilling parameters) and outputs, opening avenues for its application in diverse drilling contexts beyond geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Granite-based geopolymers have shown great potential as viable and sustainable alternatives to fully replace OPC. This article shows the impact of drilling fluid contamination (both water-based and oil-based) on the rheological and mechanical properties of such a geopolymer. The mechanisms involved in contamination are also explored. The maximum contamination intake before geopolymers lose most of their strength is investigated. Optimized granite-based geopolymer is mixed with varying volumes of a typical water-based drilling fluid (5\% and 10\%). The resulting mixture is cured under bottom hole static temperatures (BHST) of 70℃ and 13.79 MPa pressure to simulate production casing conditions. Compressive and tensile strengths of the cured contaminated geopolymer are measured after 1, 3, and 7 days. The early strength is evaluated using the Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer (UCA). The impact of the drilling fluid on the geopolymer's microstructure is analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results show that the geopolymer is more sensitive to the Water-Based Mud (WBM), and slurry does not develop strength after 1 day if contaminated with higher than 10\% WBM. This behavior is due to geopolymerization reaction in which water remains in the system, unlike the consumption of water in OPC due to hydration. Particle sedimentation is also increased as more contamination is introduced into the geopolymer. SEM images show that after contamination with OBM, geopolymer slurry becomes an oil in water emulsion which leaves dispersed oil in pores throughout the sample after the setting phase.}

	abstract		= {Eleven (``10 + 1") mechanisms of mechanical degradation that can compromise the wellbore integrity are evaluated by modeling the stress evolutions within the casing-cement sheath-rock formation (C/CS/RF) system. Past attempts from the published literature overlooked the need for establishing an initial stress state that yields stability following cement setting (wait-on-cement). A novel approach is used to calibrate for the initial stress distributions assuming effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity along the CS's interfaces with the steel casing and the adjacent-RF.  Established analytical expressions form what is generally recognized as the basic stress analysis inside the casing walls and the RF region adjacent to a well. A calibration procedure is necessary to extend the stress model into the CS layer between the casing and the adjacent-RF considering effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity. Our mechanistic model is capable of evaluating against four failure mechanisms in the casing layer considering collapse, burst, tensile, and/or compressive stress loads, four failure mechanisms in the CS layer (inner or outer debonding, radial cracking, disking, and shear cracking), along with longitudinal and transverse tensile/"Mode I" fracture initiation in the RF layer (an "underground blowout"), and finally potential reactivation via shear-slippage of natural, pre-existing faults at close proximity, that could trigger seismic events.  Post-blowout-reservoir depletion, followed by pressurization after successful capping stack shut-in presents one of the biggest challenges vis-\`{a}-vis wellbore integrity. A case study is presented, assessing the wellbore integrity during the aftermath of the MC 252-1 "Macondo Well'' blowout from April 20, 2010, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The results differ from those of previous studies and we think are more realistic due to the improved approach used for calibrating for the initial stress distributions. Wellbore integrity is maintained during the heavy-pressure depletion that the reservoir experienced throughout the 86.2-day post-blowout-discharge period and the subsequent wellbore-pressure buildup that followed the successful well capping.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry has for decades learned about safety from the analysis of failure, adverse events, incidents, and accidents. This approach is called ``safety-I". Safety-I has helped the industry reach a plateau of general high levels safety, measured as the absence of incidents, compared to other industries, but there is still room for further and continuous improvements. Researchers in human factors and safety have suggested that safety critical industries, in the future, should not only learn from failure, but also from the normal everyday successful work. This approach is called "safety-II" (Hollnagel et al. 2015), and, in a report from The International Association of Oil \\\& Gas Producers (2022), "learning from normal work". The paper describes the practical implementation and roll-out of safety-II and learning from normal work on board operating drilling rigs.  The learning from normal work project covers 3 phases:Phase 1: The onboard studies of positive practice, i.e., ethnographic observations of normal daily work and conversations with crew members, e.g., on the drill floor.  Phase 2: The development and prototype testing of learning material based on the onboard observations and training of onboard facilitators in the learning team format.  Phase 3: The final validation of the learning from normal work concept in a ramp-up case study on a rig starting a new drilling campaign.  More than 160 examples of positive practice from 5 different rigs (2 drillships, 2 jackups and 1 semisubmersibles) were collected in the first phase of the learning from normal work project. The examples illustrate how crews add safety to the process by, e.g., the way they communicate and interact, the way they use technology or the way they plan and discuss their work. The positive examples were filtered and used to generate learning material in the form of learning cards for interactive discussions of safety in learning teams and positive examples to be used in safety meetings and presentations for inspiration as an alternative to failure and incident cases.  One important conclusion from the learning from normal work project is that the crews contribute to the safety of the process through their behavior and small actions in the daily routine work. Thereby, they put many small "safety nets" in place in the system making it resilient and strong.  Looking at positive practice and positive events is new when discussing safety. It changes the narrative and the focus of the discussion from "what to avoid" to "what to do more" and "what to develop and support''. This philosophy is based on positive reinforcement as a motivating and driving factor.}

	abstract		= {This manuscript presents a comprehensive account of the development and experimental validation of an automated drilling fluid mixing system. This project is a joint technology venture between Equinor and Baker Hughes. The paper explains the critical aspects of designing an automation solution for a traditionally manual-oriented workflow. The system comprises a rig site software application for creating and managing mix sheets, a machine learning algorithm that suggests chemical mixes based on fluid properties, a real-time sensor system for monitoring fluid properties, and an OPC-UA communication protocol for sharing a digital mix sheet with automation hardware systems.  The development of an automation system entails a comprehensive software application design that enables a gradual shift from manual to an automated workflow, fostering increased user confidence. The initial phase involved providing field engineers with the ability to manually create and organize the mix sheet. The second stage integrated a machine learning algorithm that allowed engineers to generate suggested mix sheets based on available products, current and target fluid properties. Once reviewed, the mix sheet is dispatched to an external automation solution for execution. Any changes made by the engineer to the suggested mix sheet are recorded to improve the algorithm. In the third phase, a real-time sensor system monitors and feeds data to the software, enabling the algorithm to generate a chemical mix in response to deviations or projected variations from target specifications. The use of OPC-UA communication protocol ensures versatility, scalability, and the seamless transmission of digital mix sheets to third-party automation systems.  The automation software system was tested in drilling fluid automation lab of Equinor located at Sandsli Automatic Drilling Fluid Laboratory, Norway with three objectives: 1) Demonstrate the usability in rig and remote operations scenario, 2) Communication with rig automation system, and 3) Verifying the algorithm output. The testing proved the viability of using the application and a seamless transition from manual workflows to automation. This also demonstrated the ability of the application to support remote operation by lowering the workload and improve efficiency. A water-based fluid system was prepared at the lab for testing the algorithm output validity. The generated mix sheet was published to the OPC-UA server hosted in the application. The accuracy of the algorithm has already been verified earlier in a lab experiment.  To conclude, the design of an automation system for the drilling fluid operations must consider the human factors, support rig and remote operations workflow and eventually capable of working in full autonomy. It must be able to communicate with other automation system via a standard, scalable and secure protocol like OPC-UA to ensure adoption. The solution developed for drilling fluid automation, the ML algorithm and communication methodology is novel in the industry and helps operators and service companies to improve service delivery quality, safety, and sustainability.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry pushes for longer, faster, and more reliable well construction. Predicting and optimizing drill bit performance offers tremendous potential to achieve high rate-of-penetrations. Torsional and lateral vibrations are detrimental to bits and drilling tools. Specifically, High-Frequency Torsional Oscillations (HFTO) can lead to electronic failures, body cracks and twist-offs of drilling tools. A recently upgraded full-scale drilling rig enables the analysis of drilling speed and generated high frequency vibrations under laboratory conditions. This paper presents new methods to optimize bit performance and stability fast, at low costs and low risks for performance and stability in a controlled environment. The results are validated by field operations in North America Land.  Four bit designs were used to drill rocks under realistic downhole pressure and WOB and RPMs in the lab. High-frequency sensors at the rig and in the bit capture the rate-of-penetration and the dynamic response at multiple combinations of operative parameters. The data allow a full assessment of the performance, efficiency and lateral and torsional stability of bits using stability-maps, Rate of Penetration (ROP)-maps, MSE maps and Depth-of-Cut (DOC)-WOB curves. The lab tests are supported by {3D} full bit simulations. The lab results are compared to field operations in vibration prone rocks in North America. The field runs were drilled in comparable well paths, formations and BHAs enabling a direct comparison. The bottom-hole-assemblies (BHA) were simulated and compared to high-frequency downhole data, surface data and offset-wells. Recommendations for choice and operation of the drill bits are deduced to reduce loads on the BHA while increasing drilling performance.  The best bit design showed a 33\% higher ROP while increasing the torsional stability. Stability maps revealed stable regions of RPM-WOB combinations free of torsional vibrations. HFTO can be mitigated by increasing the rotational speed above an RPM threshold. The range of HFTO free operative parameters was enlarged by 40\% through bit design optimization. The best bit design also showed superior performance in the field achieving instantaneous ROP of more than 1,000 ft/h. Multiple record runs have been achieved with this frame including the most recent of drilling greater than 12,000 ft in a 24-hour period and drilling more than 25,000 feet in a single run.  The new bit optimization methods enable to improve bit designs, develop operational recommendations quicker, minimize costs, and deliver more precise and reliable solutions compared to optimizations in field operations. Improvements of the performance and the torsional stability simultaneously are made possible through the upgraded drilling rig. The suppression of HFTO by bit design and cutter configuration combined with expanded stable operating parameters will lead to increased tool reliability, less NPT and higher drilling performance.}

	abstract		= {Drilling automation and remote operations are driving advisory systems to provide a safe operating environment, protect the wellbore, and optimize efficiency at the wellsite. These interoperable systems deliver guidance to control systems, for example set points and limits for drilling parameters. The Drilling and Wells Interoperability Standard Industry Group (D-WIS) under the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) wants to accelerate interoperable system implementation by outlining a compelling value case.  The adoption of drilling operation automation systems is increasing operational efficiency and opening new opportunities to manage drilling with advisory systems. These systems are the focus of efforts in interoperability (i.e., plug-and-play functionality) to remove data communication obstacles and allow the implementation of the next generation of advisory and process control technology. This paper describes the technology focus, status, and impact of the current industry efforts and organizations contributing to interoperable systems regarding the core system components and standardization needs. The value case is made for an interoperability standard suitable for large scale industry deployment.  The current industry state reveals custom-made supplier solutions continuing to expand and evolve with limited applicability due to a bespoke approach. The authors observe and contrast this method with an interoperable system approach to make the value case in terms of easier and faster implementation and scalability, better reliability and access to data, and lower development and operations cost, resulting in a higher overall value. A comparison of the two competing scenarios along with past industry efforts toward standardization clarifies how to best realize the vision of safely and efficiently sharing information and facilitating drilling operations. Collaborative efforts between industry organizations also help address areas of overlap and gaps related to interoperability and creation of a standard. The conclusions outline the minimum requirements of a focused industry effort to deliver an implementation-ready system. System adoption is accelerated by creating deliverables fit for roadmaps and specific collaboration points.  The paper examines the effectiveness of current interoperable system efforts. It describes and demonstrates industry influencing work towards interoperable drilling systems and builds on a collection of industry work beyond Sadlier and Laing 2011, and Macpherson et al. 2013.}

	abstract		= {Integrated Riser Joints (IRJ) have become a key component of deepwater Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) operations. They enable the surface MPD system to be integrated with the riser, allowing for safe and fast installation and retrieval despite complexities.  Deepwater MPD integrated riser joints are made up of (a) a below-tension-ring rotating control device (BTR-RCD) to create a seal around the drill string during the drilling and tripping process. (b) an MPD annular packer that serves as an alternative sealing device when the rotating control device (RCD) or active control device (ACD) is not deployed or needs maintenance (c) a flow spool featuring valves and tie-in points for hoses facilitating the circulation of drilling fluids from downhole to surface equipment. (d) Choke, kill and boost line conduit to interface with the rigs riser joints. The instrumentation system installed on the IRJ enables real-time wellbore pressure monitoring and remote control of MPD flow line valves. The choke, kill boost conduits as well as mux line clamp locations facilitate a normal riser set up for surface to subsea blowout preventer (BOP) communications.  IRJs that are deployed for deepwater MPD installations represent a significant advancement over the systems used in early floating rig MPD operations. They are designed for efficient and safe deployment and are compatible with a variety of deepwater drilling systems. MPD integrated riser joints operate in a complex wellbore condition allowing efficient and effective wellbore pressure control, improving the safety of deepwater drilling operations. It enables real-time monitoring of the wellbore parameters allowing drilling supervisors and engineers to make timely adjustments to drilling parameters. This technical paper reviews key design considerations of different IRJ systems developed by the industry and used in deepwater MPD operations. The paper examines how the IRJ system has evolved over time due to the requirement for a more efficient method of deploying RCD and annular isolation devices in deepwater wells.  The authors provide an unbiased view on the recent developments of Integrated Riser Joint technology based on their experience and actual application of the system worldwide.}

	abstract		= {This paper examines the progression of drilling performance in the top sections of offshore wells within the Arab Gulf region. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of well trajectory design, drill bit selection, directional bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, mud systems, and the application of advanced drilling optimization techniques. In the offshore fields under study, the top section typically involves drilling through formations at a range of depths with moderate inclinations. Despite the relatively straightforward technological requirements, such as using motor BHA in combination with rock bits and sea water as the base fluid, this section presents significant operational challenges.  Drilling Evolution in the Top Section Offshore Arabian GulfThe initial drilling approach in these wells, characterized by frequent total losses and execution complications, led to considerable inefficiencies. Key challenges included dealing with anti-collision risks, managing complex geophysical dynamics, and addressing issues arising from soft formation drilling, such as lack of directional control and frequent stuck pipe incidents. The use of sea water as a mud system added to these complications, particularly in deeper sections where its inability to effectively transport cuttings increased the risk of pack-offs.}

	abstract		= {The fastline is the part of the drilling line running between the drawworks drum and first sheave of the crown block assembly. Lateral vibrations of the fastline can be severe, have a negative effect on wear rates, and can cause damage to equipment with subsequential downtime. In the worst cases, severe vibrations can cause injury or even be fatal to personal. The goal of this paper is to show how a simulation model can help to identify risk factors and remedies to minimize the likelihood of spooling errors and other hazards.  This paper presents the results from an advanced simulation model describing both the generation and decay of fastline vibrations. The model includes a dynamic drawworks model having many features, such as a multilayer Lebus drum spooling, line elasticity, sheave and line inertia, and realistic speed control response of the drawworks motors. The simulation results strongly indicate that a dominating high-risk factor for error spooling is a low fastline tension force resulting from a combination of a low hook load and dynamic effects, like a high fastline speed and a rapid speed ramp-down (high deceleration rate). Other risk factors include poor damping of the generated fastline vibrations and high fastline inclination (deviation from vertical). Even though inherent bending resistance of the wire rope is a significant damping mechanism for high-frequency vibrations, it is very weak for low-frequency vibrations generated by tension variations or by axial deflection speed reversal at layer shifts. The improved model also shows that a conventional stabilizer dampens fastline vibrations poorly. In contrast, a new type of the stabilizer, which is placed closer to the fast sheave and uses passive but tuned dampeners, shows promise. Even though it is placed at a further distance from the drum, simulations strongly indicate that it can effectively dampen low frequency fastline vibrations and thereby decrease the risk of hazards.}

Deep water drilling technologies are universally recognized among the front runner along this road map, coming from a long journey of trials and errors and capable only in the recent years to move close to the full potential made by the integration, completely machine controlled, of multiple rig equipment.  This paper describes one among the first experience made in the industry of such process control automation set up on the 7th generation drilling ship Saipem Santorini in Gulf of Mexico over the years 2022 and 2023.  Results achieved clearly demonstrate a tangible enhancement of the work safety, as the human/machine interface is lowered by near the 50\% along the whole well construction process, as well as the drilling and completion performance went beyond the 10\% of global well time reduction, just as a starting point.  This first experience has been documented over a collaborative one-year period through advanced KPI monitoring and systematic approach used for installation, training, remote support and data analytics that illustrates a proven path to success which is going to be reiterated soon up to a level of a new standard for deep water drilling.}

The new automated real-time workflow, with three smart agents for pore pressure, mudweight and well pressure was tested on historical data and real-time drilling campaigns for one exploration well and several production wells in the North Sea and offshore Mid-Norway. A digital workflow is set up from pre-drill {3D} basin scale pore pressure modelling using a stochastic Monte-Carlo approach, including an automated update of pressure prognosis while drilling using sonic or resistivity data. Additionally, the innovative approach will also reduce the uncertainty in the predicted mud-weight window ahead of the bit. Three new smart agents have been implemented in a real-time data platform for drilling; one for pore pressure prediction, one for mudweight real-time calculations and one for well pressure real-time predictions.  The new automated workflow has been tested on several wells, either in real-time, or on historical data as playback. Both pressure real-time updates using sonic log (for exploration well) and resistivity data (for production well) have been tested with very good results, especially when filters on the raw log data are used, removing artefacts in input data, effect of well inclinations, lithologies etc. In addition, the real-time Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) prediction has been compared with downhole ECD measurements. Digital twin using playback data from a well, offshore Mid-Norway has been carried out with automated correction and smoothing of the calculated pore pressure from resistivity log. The new automated workflow will contribute to increase the efficiency of drilling operations subject to narrow pressure margins and uncertain reservoir pressure, by providing a quantitative and adaptive automated workflow to support the drillers/rig crews.  The new automated workflow is presented for both exploration and production wells and the workflow can contribute to more cost effective and safer operations. The methodology can in the future be combined with machine learning.}

	abstract		= {Drilling geothermal and HPHT wells is complicated by exposure of downhole tools to high temperatures. Pro-active downhole temperature management is therefore very important to prevent heat-related tool failure which can result in significant non-productive time and increased costs. Temperature management that relies heavily on surface cooling is currently mostly a manual process. This paper presents a control-oriented platform to achieve automated managed temperature drilling in real-time. For the controller, an improved reduced drift-flux model that considers temperature dynamics, interface mass transfer, and a new lumped pressure dynamics model is used. By considering these factors, the model is used to digitally twin the transient thermal behavior of geothermal wells. The improved temperature model is validated using experimental results from the Utah FORGE 16A(78)-32 dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the model, it is used in conjunction with a controller to simulate maintaining a sufficiently cool bottom-hole temperature for downhole tools in various drilling scenarios. These thermal control scenarios demonstrate that the model can be used for control design, which effectively controls the downhole temperatures during the well construction process. This paper presents the first control-oriented platform that automatically manages the downhole temperature in a geothermal or HPHT well. By using a model capable of real-time simulation, automatic and predictive control algorithms can be applied to reduce negative thermal effects during drilling, thereby significantly decreasing non-productive time events and the cost of constructing a geothermal well.}

	abstract		= {Many models in the industry use the notion of an effective length to make predictions about the bottom hole assembly (BHA), whether for its directional behavior or its lateral vibration tendency. A given criteria is chosen to cut the drill string at a certain distance from the bit and use only that part for the computations. In this paper, this cutting distance is referred to as the effective length. Though computationally efficient, and thus providing fast real-time predictions, there is no consensus on what criteria should be chosen, nor a ``bulletproof recipe'' on how to compute that length. Miscalculating this effective length, especially for vibration mitigation purposes, can lead to suboptimal rotation speed selection, potentially causing failure.  To address this challenge, different choices of effective length computations are compared in terms of BHA yield rate prediction (build/drop and turn rate). Past a given distance from the bit, the computed side force and tilt at the bit are nearly identical, meaning that any element very far from the bit is negligible in the static calculation. However, studying lateral vibrations is more complex especially at low inclinations or in horizontal wells with high weight on bit (WOB) where the drill string can move more freely with snaking and whirling motions. A nonlinear time-domain model is utilized to evaluate the propagation of lateral vibrations up the string. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted on several BHA types and lengths, considering different boundary conditions in vertical and horizontal wells.  Directional models are found to be reasonably unsensitive to the choice of the effective length because they are based on steady-state computations, but the same cannot be stated for dynamics. This study developed a more robust approach to estimate properly the effective length for lateral vibrations, an essential for BHA resonance. The theoretical predictions of critical speeds were compared to time-domain simulations, which take into account the nonlinearities related to contact and friction forces. Spectral analysis of the results helped identify the main sources of vibration, whether it comes from BHA mass imbalance, drill string-wellbore interactions, or other sources. This combination between frequency- and time-based analyses is used to validate our choice of the effective length.  Many models, from steady state to dynamics with both frequency and time domain analysis, are used to approach the effective length problem from various perspectives. This study aims to compensate the lack of in-depth analysis on this important subject. It shows the importance to understand the strengths and limits of frequency-based models compared to the more complex time-domain modeling.}

	abstract		= {Downhole drilling dynamic data has proven to be valuable operational information for vibration mitigation and drilling optimization. Yet, the downhole dynamic behavior of the BHA is often misinterpreted. Most downscaled experimental investigations neglect the changes in dynamic field conditions due to fluid flow. The objective of this work is to establish a visual understanding of downhole vibration data analysis in the presence of fully circulated fluid flow and to investigate the effect of flow rate on the BHA lateral trajectory, using a scaled laboratory BHA. A mechanically downscaled test assembly adhering to the geometric and material property relations of a field-size BHA section was designed and manufactured to investigate the nature of lateral vibration under field-like fluid flow conditions. Axial excitation and rotation were induced respectively using an electromagnetic shaker and an electrical motor. Fluid was pumped through the BHA using an electric pump and an in-house designed swivel. The BHA trajectory was mapped using inductive displacement sensors mounted outside the transparent wellbore structure for direct visual correlation between the BHA movement and the vibration data. Real-time induced bit vibration was observed and recorded using a high-frequency tri-axial accelerometer. The results from this experiment provide precise and insightful visual information for BHA trajectory correlation with the acceleration data acquired under field-like fluid flow conditions. The BHA vibration behavior of high-frequency accelerations (shock and vibration), critical lateral vibration phenomena such as whirling, and shift in dominant vibration frequencies were characterized based on both the nature of dynamic forces at the bit and fluid flow rates. Instead of a general observation of the vibration-damping effect in the presence of circulating fluid, the experiment also presents correlations between vibration characteristic changes at different frequencies for different flow rates. In conclusion, the investigation distinguishes between the dynamic relation of fluid damping of vibration and fluid-induced vibrations, both in relation to the dynamic vibration data and the downhole dynamic behavior of BHA movement. The novel experiment establishes both quantitative and qualitative relations between the observation of acceleration data and physical vibration behavior during drilling in the presence of circulating fluid. The experimental results provide clear insight not only into the dynamic nature of vibration-damping but also into fluid-induced vibrations, which affect the window of safe operating drilling conditions.}

	abstract		= {An operator in Colombia applied a splitter well arrangement for the first time to provide an optimal directional drilling design and execution strategy based on cutting edge surveying technology, data analytics, and a calibrated magnetic scan model. The drilling faced the challenges of potential well collision scenarios with pressure risk. Knowledge-sharing from the operation offers a benchmark for magnetic scan and trajectory design methodologies to aid in addressing complexities associated with directional drilling.  For the first time, the operator implemented gyro-while-drilling (GWD) technology with a solid-state sensor, specifically for surface sections. Optimal intervals for GWD and MWD runs were identified through a calibrated magnetic scan model. Data analytics and visualizations supported a safer design and execution of nine complex horizontal wells in a splitter well arrangement. This approach facilitated the continuous capture and application of lessons learned, enhancing the operator's well-by-well strategy. Pressure and collision risk challenges were effectively managed using a comprehensive exemption process and a robust prevention and mitigation plan.  Results from drilling in sequence from surface to production (not in batch), nine splitter wells have shown zero health, safety, and environment events, zero well collision events, successful wellbore departure with the inertial toolface of GWD, and effective directional control with geological targets achieved while preserving a safe separation distance between the splitter wells without need of trajectory replanning or increase of drilling risks. The GWD sensor was the primary surveying tool for the surface section in a 12 \textonequarter{}-in. hole size. Measurement-while-drilling tools transmitted real-time data to surface. The azimuth measurements proved enough accuracy to be used as reference after being compared to GWD, even in the presence of high external magnetic interference. These measurements provided a benchmark for a well arrangement at low separation distance at the well reference point and demonstrated an acceptable accuracy to use MWD measurement at magnetic scan separation starting from 15 ft for the casing design used in this campaign. The magnetic scan model was an effective method to define the GWD interval for the well. These nine wells resulted in 60\% land use reduction over conventional designs; the technical viability of the splitter well project is important for a more sustainable future of drilling operations in Colombia. This was the first use of the GWD solid state sensor in Colombia and the first splitter well arrangement for the operator. This case study from the Rubiales field leverages data to take right decisions and will provide practical guidance to engineers facing similar challenges in constrained drilling environments for sequential drilling.}

The growing trend towards long-term industrial scale CCS presents challenges for the current industry design capabilities. In conjunction with the wider CCS system design, particular engineering design and integrity assurance requirements must be addressed for the wellbore components.  An appropriate Equation of State which accounts for impurities and multi-phase flow conditions is required to predict rapid changes in fluid behavior. With a depleted gas reservoir as the storage target, early-life versus late-life wellbore conditions can be significantly different. The tubular design workflow was finalized using a CO2 Injection Model deployed via a cloud-based software platform developed in concert with the well engineering design process in an agile manner. Validation of the model was provided by comparison with benchmarks from legacy software.  Coupled with drilling and cementing conditions from the well construction phase, the resultant thermal stresses on tubulars, connections and completion components during gaseous, dense and multi-phase CO2 well operating conditions need to be accurately predicted as they can be significant. Downhole conditions can be affected by cooling from adiabatic expansion and Joule-Thomson effects across chokes, due to wellbore friction and at the sand face. Transient operations during shut-in and restart result in low design case temperatures. Low-probability survival conditions under simulated blowout or leakage scenarios require to be modeled and can result in worst-case temperature qualification requirements for wellbore equipment.  Industry work groups have proposed the GERG-2008 Equation of State as a standard model for CCS operations and well design. However, potential limitations noted in technical literature appear evident from detailed well sensitivity analysis. Potential improvements to the GERG-2008 model as well as requirements for an improved fit for purpose Equation of State are outlined.}

	abstract		= {The Gulf of Mexico plays a pivotal role in the United States’ energy landscape, serving as the primary offshore source of oil and gas. It contributes approximately 97\% of all oil and gas production on the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Within this dynamic offshore environment, numerous major operators manage a variety of platforms and systems. Notably, a longstanding pioneer in the Gulf region has been at the forefront of technological advancements in the design, construction, and operation of world-class oil and gas production facilities for over four decades. The prominence of being one of the Gulf’s key operators comes with both advantages and challenges that must be addressed as part of the daily operational landscape. Historically, this operator has adhered to its established best practices and remained loyal to proven strategies, which can pose challenges when introducing new products or technologies.  In May 2021, a situation arose when a client contacted a multinational service company, seeking assistance with a well in the production phase located adjacent to the Mississippi Canyon. A case of Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP) emerged in the B-Annulus, necessitating a resolution within an extremely tight timeframe of just 2-3 weeks. In response to this critical situation, our organization was tasked with delivering a solution to remediate the well afflicted by SCP and hydrocarbon (HC) flow issues. Within our extensive technology portfolio, a Flexible Self-Healing Cement (FSHC) system was identified as the ideal solution to ensure well integrity from drilling through abandonment, providing a reliable annular pressure seal and safeguarding against hydrocarbon leaks and SCP at the wellhead. Tailored to meet the client’s unique challenges and specifications, this system was deemed the most suitable choice for the operation. This paper delves into the comprehensive development, execution, evaluation, and post-job analysis of the inaugural application of the Flexible Self-Healing Cement system in the Gulf of Mexico. This innovative system promises to address the pressing challenges posed by SCP and HC flow, further enhancing the operational efficiency and well integrity in this strategically vital region.}

	abstract		= {Wellbore intersections are typically achieved using a conventional rotary drilling rig and wireline deployed magnetic ranging tools. Separate trips are made for each system in order to intersect a target wellbore. While this approach is often successful, it is time-consuming, resulting in more time spent on tripping than drilling. The extended trip times and the potential for well control vulnerabilities are issues that require attention. This paper introduces a novel solution to address these concerns.  The primary objective is to expedite wellbore intersections while improving process safety. The field-tested solution presented here involves the implementation of a coiled tubing ranging while drilling system, integrating electric current injection and sensor assembly into a single BHA with a live data connection to the surface. By eliminating separate wireline runs and reducing jointed pipe trip times, operations are significantly accelerated while dramatically improving key performance metrics. A high density of ranging data sets, averaging 3,800 samples per minute, was maintained during drilling. This method offers an efficient and safe alternative by combining multiple independent services at the wellsite into an end-to-end solution. Furthermore, the technology provides additional safety barriers that are not feasible with conventional methods.  The commercial demonstration results describe the successful deployment of the novel system, potentially yielding up to five-fold efficiency improvement compared to legacy techniques widely accepted in the industry. This new approach enables a significant advancement in wellbore intercept techniques, paving the way for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and success in challenging wellbore environments.}

	abstract		= {Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) is used extensively in the drilling industry for numerous purposes, most commonly as a strategy for drilling optimization. Additionally, MSE is used for determination of rock hardness, development and assessment of drilling parameters roadmaps, benchmarking, and drilling efficiency calibrations. MSE, in addition to being used for identification and remediation of drilling dysfunctions, is also utilized in completions design optimization for unconventionals. These applications of MSE are important in all drilling operations, regardless of asset class, from exploration through development.  MSE deployment is grounded in several strongly held positions, with associated implications. In Part-1 (SPE 212508) of this critical conversation, which attracted intense industry debate, it was revealed that most MSE claims lack factual validations, and that the assertions had numerous fallacies and pitfalls. These findings, which established limitations and inefficiencies in MSE deployment, are critical for the industry. Most importantly, awareness of MSE shortfalls will ensure development of effective, and verifiable solutions for drilling efficiency improvement. MSE initiatives and claims must be held true, supported by operational objectives, and ratified by physics and drilling mechanics principles.  This follow-up paper identifies additional MSE deficits, with primary focus on its claims. These assertions, as will be discussed include the following \textendash{} performance benchmarking, drilling efficiency quantification and improvement, identification of performance risks and limiters, recognition, and remediation of drilling dysfunctions \textendash{} regardless of asset class and/or application type. Fallacies and pitfalls associated with these claims will be identified and analyzed, through appropriate physics-based processes, where the erroneous implications of these claims, will be identified and discussed. In addition to supporting these positions with appropriate field data, a new systematic ``Five-Step'' process (AIVReC) for discussing dysfunctions will be introduced. It is worth noting that this paper’s positions promote development of appropriate workflows for data analytics and drilling automation processes. These needs cannot be achieved with current MSE positions and claims, because of the numerous fallacies and pitfalls.}

	abstract		= {Poor hole cleaning is often the cause for drilling performance deterioration, many times leading to detrimental situations such as pack-offs and stuck pipe.  In addition to high flowrate and rotational speed, lateral oscillations of the drill-string on the low-side of inclined wells were shown to improve hole cleaning. However, the drill-string lateral oscillations are usually not controlled in any way. This paper proposes a solution to trigger the lateral movement of the drill-string at certain positions, with simulation results to support the novel concept.  Generally, it is desirable to damp out drill-string vibrations as they impact drilling performance, can cause severe damage to drill-string/bottom hole assembly components, or destabilize the formation rocks. A solution based on distributed damping subs along the drill-string has been proposed to eliminate stick-slip and other forms of torsional vibrations. These damping subs utilize magnetic viscous damping through eddy current braking and their design enables active control of the damping strength. The latter fact allows to consider a coordinated control of the damping strength to initiate a controlled low amplitude lateral movement of the drill-string that can facilitate hole-cleaning while simultaneously attenuating torsional oscillations of the drill-string.  A simulated environment was used for verifying the proposed solution. It includes a transient stiff-string torque and drag model which accounts for axial, torsional and lateral displacements. The viscous damping subs are included in the model at defined locations along the drill-string. Several distributed control strategies have been simulated and the induced lateral movement of the drill-string has been analyzed. Simulations were performed with a well configuration from a field case. The first series of simulated experiments were focused on controlling the amount of viscous damping for all subs simultaneously with the same magnitude. It was observed that the effect on the lateral movement in this case was minor. In a second approach, subs placed at different locations had different damping strengths that were varied at specific time steps. Controlling the damping in a distributed fashion had a stronger effect on the local lateral movement and it was possible to create different localized movement patterns along the drill-string.  The concept of utilizing distributed damping subs along the drill-string opens the possibility to actively control the local lateral movement of the drill-pipes and therefore enhance hole cleaning performance. At the same time, torsional oscillations are damped out. Furthermore, the damping subs reduce the overall required torque at the top-drive and facilitate weight transmission to the bit.}

The objective of this work was to study realistic field scale scenarios in a test well and develop a predictive model using the data. The model helps in simulating field scenarios and efficient planning of fluid logistics with significant economic impact. We present an industry first well scale study that demonstrates the impact of flow regime and solubility using Argon \\\& Nitrogen on gas migration. A 5200-ft-deep vertical test-well with 9-5/8{''}x2-7/8{''} annulus equipped with 4 downhole pressure/temperature gauges and fiber optic DTS/DAS is utilized for the field-scale experiments. Tests were conducted by injecting gas at the bottom and observing its migration in the static mud column, followed by flushing to simulate PMCD shut-in and flushing cycles. The impact of gas solubility, bottomhole pressure (BHP) and gas injection rates were studied. Nitrogen/Argon gases were used to introduce solubility differences. To estimate gas migration rates, a mathematical model was developed and calibrated with the test data. The flow regime and gas solubility in the mud were found to be the most important factors in determining gas migration rates. Flow regime transition from Cap to Taylor bubbles was observed when BHP was rapidly dropped from 3600 to 2290 psi, with a threefold increase in gas migration rates. Argon gas migration rates were \textasciitilde{}half that of nitrogen under the same test conditions which is in line with the gas solubility differences between the two gases. The gas migration rate increased non-linearly with injection rates between 0.1 to 6 bpm. The simulation model utilized well known Cap bubble correlations along with Henry's law and was found to adequately model the test results. Reported field case histories were also modeled and the results compared well with reported gas migration rates (\textasciitilde{}0.01-0.4 ft/sec) for both water and oil-based muds. The minimum mud bullheading rate to flush gas was found to be 100 gpm (0.6 ft/sec) and was \textasciitilde{}15 \% higher than the gas migration rate; this helps in determining the minimum field required flushing rate. The gas migration model accounts for solubility in the mud, pressure in the wellbore influencing gas flow regime, and gas influx rates and predicts results in-line with observed field case histories.}

This method integrates high-resolution images and {3D} data (points in {3D} space), collected in real-time using an integrated laser-based sensor previously tested in the field. Additionally, we analyze the effect of the morphological characteristics of cuttings/cavings on the volume correction factor, which is a function of the void space, when these are stacked up.  The proposed method encompasses (1) the identification of individual cuttings/cavings in the data (segmentation), (2) the extraction of their morphological characteristics, and (3) the estimation of their bulk volume, as well as their effective volume (without the interstitial void space) when these are stacked. To achieve these outputs, our method incorporates (1) optimized image pre-processing methods, (2) state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, (3) ellipse-fitting algorithms, and (4) numerical integration of the {3D} data. We validated the proposed method at laboratory scale simulating challenging field conditions. These conditions included poor mud/solids separation and stacked cuttings.  The assessment of the hole cleaning efficiency and wellbore stability is key to preventing undesirable non-productive time (NPT) events in drilling operations, such as stuck pipe events. The conventional method for such an assessment involves low-frequency sampling of cuttings/cavings from collector trays at the rig shale shakers, as well as their manual characterization by a human. This person infers volume, size distribution, and morphological characteristics of the returning stream. This approach results in a biased and often late evaluation of hole cleaning and wellbore stability issues, thereby missing out on opportunities to prevent NPT. Our method enables an accurate real-time characterization of cuttings/cavings, even in challenging conditions such as wet solids conditions and stacking-up. Additionally, we observed that, when the cuttings/cavings are stacked, the required correction to the initial volume estimation (derived from the integration of the {3D} data) depends on their morphological characteristics, as well as the level of stacking. Since our proposed method covers these aspects, it can also provide an accurate measurement of the solids return volume, serving as basis for a timely and accurate evaluation of hole cleaning sufficiency and wellbore stability.  This work is the first to propose a holistic, automatic, and real-time characterization of cuttings/cavings, including their volume, size distribution, and shape/morphology. Furthermore, it is the first to integrate {3D} data with high-resolution images to pursue this objective. The method proposed in this paper can be used for the real-time assessment of hole cleaning sufficiency and wellbore stability, and, consequently, for the prediction, prevention, and better management of NPT-producing events.}

	abstract		= {Automatic prediction of drilling incidents can be conducted through either a purely data-driven approach or a hybrid approach. In the first approach, the variable space is typically limited to surface measurements and downhole sensor data, while in the second approach, the variable space is expanded to include information from physics-based models. This paper analyzes the additional value of incorporating physics-based information to predict drilling incidents such as stuck pipe, illustrated using data from the Utah FORGE geothermal wells.  In our study, we trained three anomaly detection models with two distinct variables spaces. In the first one, we considered the real-time signals only, while in the second one, we included physics-based information derived from cuttings-transport, tortuosity, and torque-and-drag models. We selected three models that showed promising results in recent studies and represent the taxonomy of machine-learning-based anomaly detection algorithms. Specifically, we utilized recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and clustering. Finally, a comparison between the two approaches was performed in terms of the fidelity of the warnings they generated.  We observed that the inclusion of physics-based information is key to improving the performance of models for predicting drilling incidents. Specifically, we noted a reduction in the number of false alarms, which, in turn, increases the reliability of the models. In addition, we found that physics information can guide the selection of prediction time windows when drilling anomalies develop, thereby eliminating bias in the models' construction. Finally, we observed that some drilling anomalies, which were previously believed to occur suddenly with little warning, can, in fact, be predicted in a timely manner with hybrid models. These observations demonstrate that the use of hybrid models can significantly increase the performance of drilling anomaly predictions, providing sufficient forewarning time for their prevention and associated NPT avoidance.  State-of-the-art methods that implement purely data-driven and hybrid approaches have individually demonstrated high accuracy in predicting incidents on specific datasets. However, no previous comparative study has been conducted to analyze the value of incorporating physics-based information. This paper is the first to perform such an analysis for models aiming at the early detection of drilling anomalies. The results from this study provide valuable guidance for future NPT avoidance in drilling operations.}

The primary challenge to drill 14 3/4" section in Colombia foothills is high torque values its oscillations and vibration that produce premature damage of the {PDC} bits; specially while drilling Carbonera C5 formation, which has a very high abrasiveness and compressive strength (25 Ksi UCS). In addition to the traditional post-drilling analysis of the bit design, the use of an advanced polygonal mesh drilling simulation software in combination with laboratory test will be described as a key element to maximize the durability of the bit. This step of the process allows for the first-time an integrated analysis of the {PDC}/roller cone cutting structures all together. Analysis of the engagement balance along with the calculation of forces applied to the various cutting structure components, ultimately resulting in an improved optimization of bit performance beyond the common scenario considering the use of 4-5 {PDC} bits for the whole section.  A computational model, using a polygonal mesh simulation was developed for getting a deeper understanding of the {PDC} and roller cone interaction in the cutting structure of a hybrid drill bit; afterwards, this simulation software was calibrated with data from pressurized tests obtained in a drilling lab. Improvements of the bit cutting structure started with the ability to correlate the dull condition of the bit under several conditions of torque on bit (TOB), weight on bit (WOB) distribution and Depth of Cut (DOC). This, in turn, guided the bit design changes which were then validated by running the new design through the same simulation and achieving desirable results.  The optimized hybrid drill bit sets a footage record in the Foothills area drilling 50\% further than standard {PDC} bits and achieving 39\% more ROP than the previous hybrid bit design in offset wells. In addition to ROP and durability improvements, the original bearing \textendash{} seal life was improved from 50\% to 100\% of effectiveness with the new design for this application in this hole size. The new design features optimized the depth of cut (DOC), the weight distribution across the cutting structure and increased stability and efficiency as well. Thus, overcoming the challenge to drill further and more efficiently through these challenging formations.  A specialized team has for the first-time optimized Roller cone structure and {PDC} structure together improving bottomhole drilling dynamics, performance and bit reliability for this application through the combination of robust polygonal mesh simulations of the drilling process and pressurized rock drilling tests in a drilling lab.}

Lifua is one of the marginal fields within the Block 0 concession in offshore Angola. The development plan for these marginal fields requires short-cycle and cost-effective designs to be economically feasible. Utilizing a minimum functional objective approach, Lifua-A was planned as a proof-of-concept for this strategy which involves a repeatable solution developing a standard wellhead platform design, standard well designs and a factory-repeatable platform fabrication, installation and well execution process.  The STS design was the selected solution for the development of the Lifua field. This rig-installable platform design was first developed and installed in offshore Indonesia in 1995 with slots for three wells and rated for 150 ft of water depth. Lifua-A STS is a ten-well platform with a planned installation at a water depth of 205 ft. As a result, a new enhanced STS design and installation procedure was required. As the structural design work and fabrication progressed, the technical requirements for the jack-up rig were also developed. Upon contracting the rig, detailed engineering work was undertaken to modify the rig's cantilever system to meet the lifting and installation requirements of the STS modules. The upgrade increased the rig's cantilever longitudinal skidding capability to 85 ft with a lifting capacity of 400MT. In addition, engineering work was carried out to size and install a hydraulic hammer on the rig floor to drive the 42-in. and 36-in. conductors. Finally, the laying of the subsea flexible production flowline, thermoplastic composite water injection pipeline, and subsea power cable were all engineered in a way where they could be pulled in and up the STS platform from the rig floor utilizing a drillpipe-sling assembly and a winch cable.  The installation of the Lifua-A STS was executed according to plan, achieving the short-cycle objective by delivering the project within three years from FID to first oil. In addition, the project planning and execution was successfully carried out during the COVID pandemic. One key success factor was having the cross-functional groups working together as one team, from the development of the design to fabricating the structures and actual offshore installation. Lifua-A unlocked the marginal reserves of the Lifua field by stretching the limit of the application of the STS. This success opens the possibility of utilizing the same solution to other similar marginal fields.}

	abstract		= {During plugging and abandonment (P\\\&A), sedimented and compacted barite adds considerable complexity to the plugging operation. Casing cut and pull is alone responsible for approximately 50\% of the cost to establish a formation-formation barrier. However, if the settled barite in the annulus can be used as an additional barrier element, P\\\&A operations can be simplified, and the cost reduced. With this in mind, it is therefore necessary to investigate the sealing and mechanical properties of settled barite. In this study, settled barite from a field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is investigated to understand the mechanical and sealing properties of the settled and compacted barite from the wellbore and to compare them with cement properties. Strength and ultrasonic measurements are carried out on cored samples to assess their mechanical properties. Computed Tomography scans give an overview of the sample’s texture, and the Scanning electron microscopy provides insight on the microstructure and changes in the chemical composition of the barite from the oil well. In addition, the cohesion (or resistance to mobilisation) of barite powder is assessed by direct shear strength under various loads using a rheo-powder cell. We start by measuring the mechanical properties of settled and compacted barite, which are relatively similar in all samples. Then, compared with typical cement G, settled barite presents low stiffness and mechanical strength. Finally, we compared the mechanical properties of settled barite powders from the field with those of unused sample from the laboratory. In both cases, the barite powder exhibits low flowability, i.e., it is extremely difficult to mobilize, and this increases with humidity. In this paper, new results on the assessment of settled barite as a barrier material are reported through various mechanical, ultrasonic, and imaging tests of a realistic settled and compacted barite from an oil field and compared to an oil well cement. In this case, we observed that the settled barite has poor mechanical properties for potential use as an additional barrier element. This could be link to the original formulation of the drilling fluids used and the conditions of use in the well.}

	abstract		= {Torsional stick-slip vibrations are a significant cause of drill string damage and failure. Using damping subs distributed along the drill string has been demonstrated in both simulations and laboratory experiments as a viable solution to reduce stick-slip in drilling. The effectiveness in mitigating stick-slip can be further improved through active control of the damping strength of one or several subs. This paper evaluates a control scheme, which relies only on local downhole measurements, for various operating conditions simulated with a drill string mechanics model. Damping subs with sleeves supported on bearings and incorporated eddy current brakes are installed along the drill string, adding viscous damping to the system to mitigate torsional vibrations. The damping amount is proportional to the relative rotational speed between the sleeve and the pipe, and therefore maximized when the sleeves are non-rotating. However, if the braking force surpasses the static friction holding the sleeve in place, the sleeve slips and reduces its braking abilities. To counteract this, an On-Off-based control scheme with proportional control (P-Off controller) is implemented at the level of each sub to manipulate the value of its damping coefficient. The Off condition is triggered when local measurements indicate slipping of the sleeve. Simulations of various drilling scenarios conducted with a coupled axial and torsional drill string model show that the P-Off controller can reduce stick-slip in the system in both off-bottom and on-bottom conditions. The results indicate that the average damping coefficient, and implicitly the torque added to the system, can be greatly reduced compared to a passive damping system, consisting of the same number and positioning of subs but with constant damping coefficients. Also, the settling time of the downhole rotational speed is significantly reduced compared to the passive system. The control scheme is decentralized as it relies only on local knowledge, such as pipe rotational speed inferred from an inertial measurement unit, to estimate the top drive revolutions per minute (RPM) setpoint. Therefore, communication with the surface or with neighboring subs is not a requirement for the control implementation. The controller also shows robustness against variations in the top drive RPM and noisy downhole measurements, which is important for a real-world application. The presented approach differs from existing downhole torsional vibration damping solutions, as it does not rely on a single tool placed inside or near the bottom-hole assembly, but on several subs distributed along the drill string, with their damping strength adjusted directly downhole in a decentralized manner.}

	abstract		= {Annular shale creep barriers which can guarantee long-term well integrity over the entire lifespan of the well can be stimulated by temperature elevation caused by artificial heating inside the wellbore. Prior work has shown that heating can significantly accelerate barrier formation, but may also damage the shale formation if certain temperatures are applied. This paper reports on the optimum thermal conditions for shale barrier formation based on extensive new laboratory as well as literature data.  Thermally accelerated creep behavior was studied for the Lark and the Shetland North Sea shales. Large-scale triaxial equipment was used to study the behavior of shales under downhole stress and pressure conditions while varying temperature. In addition, an extensive literature study investigated the thermal effect of shales used for nuclear containment, such as the Boom Clay in Belgium, Cox Shale in France, and Opalinus Clay in Switzerland. The investigation focused on the impacts of temperature elevation on important shale properties such as creep rate, sealing and self-healing ability, and temperature-induced porosity, permeability, and mineralogical changes.  Both the laboratory investigation and the literature study showed that there is an optimum range for artificial thermal stimulation of shale barriers, with an upper temperature of 200\textdegree{}C \textendash{} 300\textdegree{}C that should not be exceeded. At lower temperatures, thermal pore fluid expansion may lead to effective stress reduction and shear failure on shale bedding planes. In the optimum range, fluid thermal expansion is effectively negated by thermally-induced shale consolidation, and barrier formation is optimally accelerated, which is of great practical value for field implementations. Above the optimum range, irreversible dehydration and metamorphosis of the clay constituent of the shale happen and the shale loses its ability to creep to form a barrier and self-heal. This important result shows that heating inside wellbores to improve/accelerate creep of shales needs to be a controlled, engineered process in order to yield a competent barrier. This favors the use of a temperature-controlled heater rather than a less-controllable exothermic reaction.  Shale barriers seal annuli much better and more reliably than cement barriers. Moreover, their self-healing ability offers the ability to guarantee annular well integrity for an indefinite period, including the P\\\&A phase. Thermal stimulation is preferred by operators to accelerate barrier formation without requiring annular access. The findings of this paper provide important theoretical and practical guidance on how to optimally stimulate shale barriers and avoid pitfalls associated with thermally-induced shale damage.}

	abstract		= {Well integrity issues have been widely studied in the oil and gas sector; however, with storage wells (e.g. towards natural gas, CO2 and H2), new challenges may arise due to the reactivity of the stored fluid in contact with well barrier materials, including migration and leakage of fluids. It is therefore essential to study the reaction of fluids with cement in well conditions to be able to predict the evolution of the cement annulus when exposed to fluids.  We have performed fluid flow experiments through realistic cracks in an annular cement sheath in a downscaled wellbore section. Two different experimental procedures to measure fluid flow have been investigated. The setup consists of a steel casing, cement sheath and surrounding rock. This setup provides a unique possibility to perform pressure cycling experiments to investigate cement sheath integrity and subsequent flow measurement across the 30\textemdash{}cm long cement sheath.  We compare the evolution of the flow rate of both gas (N2) and brine (liquid). Fluid flow testing with N2 and brine provides a reference measurement of the micro annuli permeability for both liquid and gas phases. As nitrogen does not react with cement, it provides a reference flow measurement. This paper reports initial and new results, measuring fluid flow as a function of inner casing pressure of a downscaled wellbore section.}

	abstract		= {A new LWD sensor is introduced for measuring a high-resolution borehole image in large boreholes and both in light and heavy oil base mud. The new sensor uses advanced radar technology, and in addition to caliper (time-of-flight) image, delivers an electrical image to help geoscientists visualize and understand the stratigraphy and fractures.  A pulse radar operating in the multi-gigahertz range is implemented within the bottom hole assembly. As the BHA rotates, the radar measurements scan the borehole surface. The time of flight is converted to a distance to the borehole wall. The amplitude of the reflected signal correlates with the micro-resistivity/permittivity of the formation in the immediate vicinity of the borehole.  Up until recently, sensors capable of performing these caliper measurements while drilling have been limited to smaller size boreholes and lighter muds. A new technology, based on a downhole radar rotating with the bottom hole assembly extends the application to boreholes of 18 inches and more in oil base mud. The same technology yields a micro-resistivity/permittivity image that is prized by the geoscientists for recognizing key geological features, including layered formations, fractures, faults, and unconformities. Here again the new technology is the first to our knowledge to obtain such information while drilling in large holes and light and heavy oil base mud.  A new technology, namely the downhole pulsed GHz radar brings a new solution to well-known problems. High resolution calipers and micro-resistivity images while drilling have been made available to the industry in recent years, however they are restricted to smaller than 12 \textonequarter{}`` boreholes and water base mud. The article below explains how and how well the new technology has significantly increased the range of applicability to oil base mud for large hole sizes, like 12 \textonequarter{}" and 17-1/2''.}

	abstract		= {Finding information across multiple databases, formats, and documents remains a manual job in the drilling industry. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in data-aggregation tasks, including answering questions. However, using LLMs for domain-specific factual responses poses a nontrivial challenge. The expert labor cost for training domain-specific LLMs prohibits niche industries from developing custom question-answering bots. This paper tests several commercial LLMs for information retrieval tasks for drilling data using zero-shot in-context learning. In addition, we studied the model’s calibration using a few-shot multiple-choice drilling questionnaire.  To create an LLM benchmark for drilling, we collated the text data from publicly available databases: the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), company annual reports, and petroleum glossary. We used a zero-shot learning technique that relies on an LLM’s ability to generate responses for tasks outside its training. We implemented a controlled zero-shot learning ``in-context'' procedure that sends a user’s query augmented with text data to the LLM as inputs. This implementation encourages the LLM to take the answer from the data while leveraging its pre-trained contextual-learning capability.  We evaluated several state-of-the-art generic LLMs available through an API, including G4, G3.5-TI, J2-ultra model, and L2 series. The paper documents the pre-trained LLMs’ ability to provide correct answers and identify petroleum industry jargon from the collated dataset. Our zero-shot in-context learning implementation helps vanilla LLMs provide relevant factual responses for the drilling domain. While each LLM’s performance varies, we have identified models suitable for a drilling chatbot application. In particular, G4 outperformed on all the tasks. This finding suggests that training expensive domain-specific LLMs is not necessary for question-answering tasks in the context of drilling data.  We demonstrate the utility of zero-shot in-context learning using pre-trained LLMs for question-answering tasks relevant to the drilling industry. Additionally, we prepared and publicly released the collated datasets from the NPD database and companies’ annual reports to enable results reproducibility and to foster acceleration of language model adoption and development for the subsurface and drilling industries. The petroleum industry may find our solution beneficial for enhancing personnel training and career development. It also offers a method for conducting data analytics and overcoming challenges in retrieving historical well data.}

	abstract		= {In this paper we make the case that data science captures value in well construction when data analysis methods, such as machine learning, are underpinned by first principles derived from physics and engineering and supported by deep domain expertise.  Despite receiving wide attention in recent years, many organizations currently struggle to derive value from their data science efforts. In our experience, disappointment arises for a multitude of reasons, which we discuss in detail. Key issues that often hinder value capture include poor data management, challenges in working with WITSML data, lack of well construction domain expertise by data science teams, inadequate use of physics and engineering and failure to adopt data science solutions into existing or new well construction workflows.  Although by no means comprehensive, we provide a summary of important data that pertains to the well construction process. We further discuss high-level areas where data science can add value to well construction through analysis of such data. Data science initiatives typically fit within at least one of the following categories: Historical Studies, Well Planning, Real-Time Well Construction Execution and Post-Drill Learning Capture. Historical studies are often good places for data science teams to initially focus their efforts. However, as insights are drawn and potential for value is shown, organizations should consider extending capabilities developed to carry-out historical studies to support well planning and real-time well construction execution workflows.  A large portion of this paper is dedicated to discussing ways that organizations can work to improve their abilities to derive value from data science efforts. Most of the discussion focuses on steps that data science teams can take today. However, our commentary on data management and governance is more forward looking. Important topics which we cover include:Data management and governance.  Serving data to data scientists.  Working with WITSML data.  Basic skills and technologies needed by data science teams.  Importance of building common capabilities for working with data.  Need for physics and engineering to inform data analysis.  Importance of identifying data quality issues.  Importance of activity-based data filtering when working with WITSML data.  Dysfunction detection using WITSML data.  Application of statistics and machine learning.  We conclude by examining several historical data science case studies for well construction. Each example highlights the need to connect data and some physical or engineering process (i.e., ``engineering with data'') to deliver value through data science.}

	abstract		= {Accurate wellbore placement and collision avoidance are increasingly important in today's tightly spaced horizontal wells and congested fields. Modern well plans incorporate hydraulic fracture geometry, reservoir characteristics, and other factors to maximize reservoir extraction while minimizing drilling costs and safety risks. Directional surveys that have minimal uncertainty are crucial to drilling the optimized well plan. This work enables more accurate directional surveys and wellbore placement through site-specific high accuracy magnetic models.  Under the Industry Steering Committee on Wellbore Survey Accuracy (ISCWSA) error model, the use of In-Field geomagnetic Referencing (IFR) dramatically reduces some of the largest sources of error in wellbore location. Unfortunately, IFR can be expensive or out of reach for smaller or less mature basins because of the high cost of flying or purchasing high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys. An economic and timely alternative has been developed, strategically taking ground magnetic measurements at sites along the wellbore(s) with absolute instruments, combined with a high-definition global magnetic model to produce IFR at the pad scale.  This method was tested in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado. A small survey team collected ground magnetic measurements over a typical pad design in one day. The data was then processed and combined with a high-definition global magnetic model to produce IFR corrections locally for the pad. This study demonstrates that the procedure reduces the horizontal wellbore position uncertainty by 46\% for the study area and more generally from 15 to 50 percent when compared to standard MWD (Measurement While Drilling) survey technology. Furthermore, this method was compared to a typical IFR model created from airborne measurements. We found that the results from the comparison agreed within tolerance to the IFR model and validated the use for IFR corrections at a pad scale. This technique improves confidence in wellbore placement, mitigates collision risks, improves reservoir drainage, and helps to maximize production.  Much work on the construction of IFR magnetic models from airborne total field data for large areas has been done. This work is novel in that it describes the construction of an IFR magnetic model from a small number of ground magnetic vector measurements, in combination with a high-definition global magnetic model for a small area. This innovative approach makes IFR corrections significantly more accessible to drilling programs with shorter timelines, fewer wells, and smaller budgets.}

This study looks to quantify the effect other parameters such as fluid loss additive concentration, fluid loss additive type (ie: film former, particle bridging or water viscosifier), foam quality and temperature have on the foamed fluid loss performance.  Base foam cement slurries were designed with in the density range of 16.6-16.8 ppg. Static fluid loss testing was conducted on all slurry designs without foaming. The slurries were conditioned in an HPHT consistometer at either 50, 66 or 90 \textdegree{}F and 6250 psi prior to conducting static fluid loss testing. Two fluid loss values for the base slurry designs were targeted (approx. 100 and 200 mL API) to quantify the effect fluid loss additive concentration has on foamed fluid loss performance. The designs were then foamed to foam qualities of 10\% and 40\% in a Multiple Analysis Cement System (MACS) analyzer and conditioned for 30 minutes before being transferred to a foamed fluid loss cell and tested.  The control slurry with no fluid loss additive was tested at 66 \textdegree{}F and foamed to a 10\% and 40\% foam quality. There was a significant decrease in fluid loss after foaming with an almost 86\% reduction in fluid loss versus the uncontrolled blowout value obtained by the base design. In the absence of fluid loss additive in the slurry, the fluid loss values showed improvement with increasing foam quality. The slurries containing a fluid loss additive showed the same reduction in fluid loss once foamed but didn’t show a significant change in fluid loss between the 10\% foam quality to the 40\% foam quality. The trend was the same for the slurries that started with an approximately 200 mL and 100 mL fluid loss. Both saw reductions when foaming but no significant change between foam quality values. An increase in slurry temperature generally produced lower fluid loss values once foamed.  Foamed fluid loss was performed and compared between slurries with and without a fluid loss additive present. Some of the slurries with fluid loss additives didn’t have fluid loss performance that correlated to foam quality. Two of the tested fluid loss additives showed a strong synergy with foaming to reduce the fluid loss. In comparison, the slurry without any fluid loss additives had fluid loss performance directly correlated to foam quality presenting some operational complexity.}

	abstract		= {The past few years have seen many experienced drilling operations personnel retire. Coincidently, the industry saw an increase in the number of drillstring failures, some of which could have potentially been avoided. These failures can result in non-productive time (NPT) like fishing trips, side tracking, or exorbitant repair bills, all of which can be costly. The consequence of these failures can be steep, and the objective of this paper is to assist with recognition and prevention of these failures. The number and type of field failures allow us to identify areas of neglect in which shared best practices may have been forgotten or not passed on. A renewed advocation of these essential drillstring running practices will help to mitigate issues before they cause operation disruption and budget overage.  In identifying issues, our intent is to recognize observed variances in running and handling practices that have potential to add complications to well construction, exacerbate budgets, and/or possibly create unsafe working environments. The solutions presented are based on actual field cases and have proven effective. More than ever, variances in best operational practices when running the string have immediate or long-term consequences. Whether the task is slips setting, connection makeup or breakout, elevator positioning, thread compound application, etc., all operations can be poorly executed when adequate information/education is not shared/passed on. As a result, over-torquing (uncontrolled down hole make-up) or, on the flipside, loosening of connections (reactive torque) is far too common and is intensified by the increase of laterals lengths.  One cannot ignore our industry's extreme drive on operation efficiency and cost reduction. Unfortunately, ignoring best practices or minimizing proven steps can be counterproductive, especially in today's more complex wellbore trajectories and demanding drilling programs. The expected outcome of this paper is to identify poor procedural conduct, explain consequences of the same, and inform drilling operations personnel with operational alternatives that will yield results. Explaining the importance and value of these best practices can renew an industry culture driven by safety and performance. Knowing and, more importantly, understanding why procedures require improvement will promote a virtuous behavior. This includes understanding the touch points and critical interfaces that the string has with the rig surface pipe handling equipment, in particular the iron roughneck and the top drive.}

By combining these multiple data sources, a comprehensive perspective of drill bit orientation is obtained, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of individual measurement methods.  The process involves assessing the current bit orientation in relation to the initial plan through RSS measurements and merging it with continuous MWD measurements, tendency estimation, and automated steering mode detection. By integrating these different elements, the process overcomes occasional low azimuth measurement precision associated with RSS due to magnetic interference.  The application of this methodology has yielded substantial improvements in accurately determining hole bottom orientation, achieving an impressive 80\% reduction in RMSE compared to conventional measurements. These results establish the methodology as a robust tool in the field of DD. Its successful implementation in drilling operations across diverse geographical locations, including North and South America, the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe, serves as a testament to its potential for widespread adoption. Notably, this methodology has been deployed in 13 different countries.  From a business standpoint, this breakthrough carries significant implications, as it serves as a pivotal digital enabler for reducing personnel requirements in directional drilling and enabling fully remote operations. Consequently, it has the potential to revolutionize the sector.  Beyond enhancing drilling efficiency and reducing operational costs, the solution offered in this study contributes substantially to sustainable well construction. This is accomplished by minimizing resource utilization and energy consumption through precise hole bottom orientation, reducing carbon emissions through remote operations, and extending well lifespans through increased drilling accuracy. The anticipated integration of real-time gyro measurements holds promise for further enhancing operational precision, thereby minimizing waste, and reducing environmental impact.  In conclusion, this transformative approach to hole bottom orientation in drilling operations holds tremendous promise for the future of Autonomous Directional Drilling, with the potential to redefine operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability within the sector.}

	abstract		= {This paper aims to track and predict the best way to run the casing string while the specific hole segment of the well is drilled. Several variables with estimated indications are monitored in real-time, and a comprehensive index is used to measure the runnability of the casing. An evaluation of whether the casing can be run without a short landing is provided by the approach created by combining geometrical and mechanical parameter calculations. This gives the opportunity to make more modifications while the well is being drilled.  Generally speaking, the borehole quality used to run the casing has an impact on the ``smoothness'' that links the wellbore geometry and mechanical system used to drill the portion of the well. It is feasible to determine the runnability of the casing for a particular hole size using complex equations represented with common sense and real-time drilling parameters. Wellbore tortuosity, borehole torsion, wellprofile energy, casing push through force, margin of slackoff force, and overpull margin all work together to facilitate the assessment of a suggested wellpath in order to ascertain the runnability of the casing. For operations like running casing in curve building sections or to total depth on lengthy laterals, combining operational experience and trajectory parameters in a methodology has shown to be an effective way to estimate operational risk. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which the runnability metrics can be adjusted in realtime with actual drilling and survey details. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which runnability measurements can be used to predict or identify other difficulties, such as intricate stimulation tasks, artificial lift functionality, and potential well servicing issues that could result from undesired curvature, borehole torsion, and wellbore drift.}

	abstract		= {Plug and abandonment activity is expected to increase and remain an active service as wells need to be permanently abandoned and/or enable slot recovery. Throughout the life of a well, degradation of the mud system in the annulus can lead to migration of mud solids, which settle at areas of high deviation or increased dogleg severity or at above the top of the cement. In this process strong engineering model is needed in addition to the logging runs to maximize the length of the cut casings, to establish higher accuracy to estimate the cutting depth. Increased reliability for Cut and Pull in a single cut/trip is needed so that it provides safety to avoid flowing fluids to mitigate barrier breakdown. Cut and pull the casing pipe conditions require fast and accurate response. This paper describes an analytical model through which drag calculations are modified to determine: the force at the deepest cut point within the given limits of the pipe conditions; the measured weight or overpull within the margin required to pull; the measured weight required pull at any depth. The total drag is the sum of the mechanical frictional forces acting on the casing during the pull operation and the fluid frictional forces due to the fluid contact with the inside and outside of the casing. In addition, any solids packed around the casing will exert a frictional force with the outside of the casing. Kinetic friction and shear force required to break the bonding are also included. The percentage of solids and sediments and length of the contaminants are estimated through logs.}

	abstract		= {For well construction, planning is one of the most important phases in the delivery of a well. To select the right engineering solutions, it is important to analyze offset data. It is common for engineers to search, index, and catalog offset data. Today, as it has been historically for the industry, this is mostly a manual task. In the past few years, many advances in the way data have been collected, stored, and sorted have made the data easier to access, but actually determining which data are similar enough to use as offset data is still done manually. In simple cases, engineers draw a circle around the coordinates of the well to be drilled and any data within that circle would be considered offset data. This method considers only the geospatial similarity of the wells, and it is used because of time and technology constraints. In our work, we developed a method for a data-driven solution to this problem of identifying offset data.  Data are critical for producing digital products and services. More than 2 years of research have led to the implementation of a powerful tool that allows users to search all global data to discover similar attributes for oil and gas data. In addition, the method includes the ability for users to define importance or allocate priorities to various features in the data. The mentioned advances in collecting, storing, and sorting data have been a major enabler in the evolution of this technology.  This work introduces a developed framework that aids in identifying offset data by implementing a dynamic data-driven solution to analyze and display the similarity of the offset well data in a new way.}

	abstract		= {In a pioneering collaboration, a major rig contractor and a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider have jointly created an innovative solution for closed-loop drilling automation. The primary focus of this technology is to achieve cost reduction per foot of drilling by employing a Machine-Learning (ML) based rate of penetration (ROP) optimizer while reducing dysfunctions. This optimizer enables remote control of rig site auto driller setpoints through a seamless cloud-to-cloud connection, without the need for any additional rig devices.  The ML ROP optimizer has been previously published in SPE publications by the SaaS provider, with references (SPE-212568-MS, SPE-208751-MS, SPE-204043-MS, SPE-URTEC-343). A rig contractor developed an Application Programming Interface (API) to receive control setpoints - weight on bit (WOB), ROP, revolutions per minute (RPM), and differential pressure (DPRES) from the optimizer. These setpoints are synchronized between cloud and edge, then to the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), ensuring reliable connection via a heartbeat mechanism. An enhanced auto driller system was deployed to improve setpoint control. Field testing involved a three-well campaign in the Permian Basin, targeting lateral sections in two formations in collaboration with a major Oil and Gas Operator.  Several key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed to evaluate the performance of the automation technology against conventional manual drilling. In Test Well 1, 52\% of lateral footage was drilled with the automation technology enabled, resulting in a 13\% improvement in ROP and successful completion of the lateral in a single bit trip. For Test Wells 2 and 3, the percentage of lateral footage drilled with the automation technology was 56\% and 48\%, respectively. On-bottom ROP was improved by 25\% on average after filtering out control drilling for rotary steerable system (RSS) downlinks. For both Test Wells 2 and 3, no unplanned trip occurred.  To mitigate the impact of high vibration during drilling, the vibration filter feature was activated for Test Well 3. This feature avoided sending setpoints that were correlated with recent high vibration. This automated mitigation approach effectively reduced vibration without requiring manual intervention. The remote control of setpoints significantly minimized the need for manual intervention, reducing driller fatigue and allowing them to focus on other critical tasks for ensuring safe drilling operations. The paper will present detailed data supporting the observations.  This paper presents an innovative integration of ML and cloud technologies, achieving real-time control of auto-driller setpoints without the need for additional edge devices on the rig. The seamless cloud connection enables scalable and remote deployment of AI and drilling automation, leading to optimized operations and cost reduction. The collaboration between an operator, rig contractor, and SaaS company sets a pioneering example of closed-loop drilling automation.}

	abstract		= {Cementing is a critical stage in the well construction process, providing zonal isolation, support, and protection for casing. Cement slurry design is a key element in cementing and represents a complex chemical process. Designing slurries with numerous chemical properties is challenging as it must account for often-contradictory requirements. Conventional slurry design relies heavily on using traditional search methods, based on applying numerous filters containing slurry composition, test conditions, additives, etc. This approach is highly ineffective, tedious, and time consuming, and can lead to suboptimal results, because of an engineer’s subjective experience and biases. In this paper we present an artificial intelligence-(AI-)based cement slurry design recommendation system that recommends the most relevant slurry designs based on slurry composition, well conditions, and laboratory test results. The original database contains \textasciitilde{}230,000 formulations and \textasciitilde{}2 million tests completed since 2018. These data are cleaned, preprocessed, and fed into the recommendation system, which is built in two steps. First, vectorization of all historical slurry records is performed with consistent feature engineering. Key slurry features include slurry composition, well conditions, and laboratory test results. Second, these vectors are used to compute similarity metrics between slurry records applying AI-based algorithms, such as clustering, exact, and approximate nearest-neighbor methods. In the inference phase, the system uses the computed similarity metrics to recommend the most relevant slurries for a set of design requirements. The AI-based system is data-driven and objectively recommends the most relevant slurries for a set of design requirements, from the database. A comparative study of the tested AI algorithms and their corresponding outcomes is presented. Specific evaluation metrics are proposed to evaluate the recommendation results. The recommended slurries are visualized in both tabular and graphical forms, for user-friendly analysis. In addition, several examples are provided that demonstrate how this innovative approach improves the slurry design methodology. The proposed approach enables retrieval of the relevant slurry candidates from a huge database in seconds, compared to performing manual search and analysis, which can take hours. The recommended slurries form a solid foundation for later stages of the slurry design process. Furthermore, smart selection of slurries saves many hours of expensive laboratory testing.}

	abstract		= {By the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an important climate action, infill drilling in CO2-rich storage sites will be expected. This implies that actions for handling an influx of CO2 into the drilling fluid must be prepared for. This study aims to close some of the many knowledge gaps when drilling for CO2 storage wells.  To detect and handle CO2 well control incidents, it is necessary to develop software tools that take properly into account the properties of CO2 and drilling fluid and how the mixture of the two performs. To support the development of a such tool, experimental characterization of density, rheology, phase envelope, hydrate formation and drilling fluid stability are performed on drilling fluids mixed with CO2 for relevant pressures and temperatures. Based on these experiments and verified thermodynamic model descriptions, local models for properties of drilling fluid-CO2 mixtures are developed and integrated in an existing drilling software suite. Considerations on similarities and differences with natural gas kicks are made.  Results from the experimental campaigns are presented and analyzed with respect to how the drilling fluid properties are affected by the CO2, e.g.: How does the phase envelope of the drilling fluid-CO2 mixture change with different amounts of CO2, i.e., to which degree is CO2 dissolved in the drilling fluid under different conditions, and when is it a free gas or liquid? What is the impact of CO2 on the drilling fluid-CO2 mixture density? Under which conditions will the constitution of the drilling fluid break down, i.e., loss of rheological properties and risk of weight material sedimentation or drilling fluid component separation?Furthermore, we consider how these effects can be captured in local constitutive models and integrated in a hydraulic model that can be used for simulating well control incidents. This study provides new insights into drilling fluid-CO2 interaction that are necessary in order to handle risks related to well control incidents when drilling into existing CO2 storage sites. The outcome of this study will help build experimentally verified model algorithms. Implemented in software tools this will enable more accurate simulations of such events than what is available now, and will help in evaluating risks, precautions and operational procedures associated with handling such events.}

	abstract		= {Advances in the properties of OPC and new materials (i.e., mechanical strength, rheological properties, etc.) have shifted the R\\\&D focus towards sealing capability of plugging materials at interfaces between the material and its adjacent medium. The objective of this paper is to outline the importance of new standards for studying hydraulic sealability of barrier materials, with emphasis on interface analysis. This work reviews different procedures used to study hydraulic sealability of barrier materials. Reviewing current standards and procedures for testing and qualifying zonal isolation materials indicates that the focus is mainly on the bulk properties of cement, such as expansion/shrinkage, permeability, and mechanical strength. The benefits of these standards are to provide reproducible results, consistent testing procedures and prevent misunderstandings about behavior of hardened cement in laboratory and field operations. However, interfaces are complex and cannot be tested with current standards, meaning that mechanical properties alone cannot indicate hydraulic sealability. The review process also includes non-setting materials further indicating the need for updated standards.  Per today, there is published work on sealability testing on the barrier material interfaces, either towards the surrounding rock or towards the casing. This is of particular importance due to more emerging well types such as CCS, hydrogen storage, geothermal wells, and purpose based well integrity and plug and abandonment. A thorough review of sealability test setups indicates that different research groups have designed setups with similar features, but with variations on scale dimensions, testing protocol and so on. This, in combination with the availability of modern measurement technologies, offers the possibility of enhanced understanding of barrier sealability. As no standards currently describe a uniform testing procedure, direct comparison of results is thus inaccurate, putting the reproducibility and reliability of analyses at risk. Our observation shows that possible considerations for standardization include understanding the effect of dimensional scales, the sequence in the procedure, the duration of testing, the type of casing steel or rock, and the type of invasion fluid besides the amount of released heat of setting material. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that current standards are updated to include sealability analysis, and updates for new and alternative materials, such as geopolymers, settled barite, and metal alloys.}

	abstract		= {The Mud-Gas Separator (MGS) is a critical component in well control for handling gas kicks. It is the primary device for separating liquid-gas mixtures in most well control events. Poor separator designs and inefficient separation of gases from liquids in the MGS have resulted in the loss of lives and equipment and adverse environmental effects. Thus, the safe and efficient separation of gases from gas-cut drilling fluids in the MGS is vital. The design and operational efficiency of the MGS depend on certain key elements in its sizing, such as the vent line length and diameter, vessel internal diameter, hydrostatic head of the mud seal, and the vent line back pressure, amongst others. These design considerations and the industrial standards and regulations governing them are hitherto not fully understood. As a result, there is an associated risk in the operation of the MGS.  This paper aims to comprehensively review and analyze key sizing and design considerations for the Mud Gas Separator for both Conventional and Managed Pressure Drilling Operations. Furthermore, industry standards, best practices, guidelines, and regulations on MGS design and operations are also reviewed.  This study uses two primary methodologies: an extensive literature review and a stakeholder engagement consultation to meet the stipulated objectives. The results indicate that the sizing and design of MGS depend on various factors such as well depth, pressure and temperature regimes, formation fluid, and completion fluid systems. The study's outcomes also indicate that existing industry standards and regulations provide sufficient guidelines for various sizing and design considerations. The study also presents an analysis of existing industry recommendations on MGS design and sizing for special wellbore conditions, formation properties, and unconventional drilling applications like managed pressure drilling (MPD).  The study provides further understanding of the MGS sizing and design from industry stakeholders’ perspective to minimize well-control risks associated with MGS.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry faces pressure to reduce emissions and minimize fuel consumption to decrease the carbon footprint of drilling operations. Like other players in the sector, drilling contractors have made a commitment to achieving measurable improvements that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the application of new technologies. The challenge is in identifying areas of operation with the greatest potential to deliver efficiency gains and finding ways to realize the reductions.  In evaluating rig operations, it became clear that optimizing engine usage has the potential to deliver considerable cost savings and at the same time improve drilling performance. Ideally, this would mean automating the process, but automating drilling processes is not straightforward. It requires in-depth knowledge of rig operations and an understanding of the interplay between the driller, who controls the drilling process, and the generators that power the rig.  One solution is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze operational data to capture drilling insights that reliably predict power usage, ensuring operations can be executed as planned and that power demand never exceeds power availability. With the introduction of AI on AC drilling rigs, data monitored by the electronic drilling recorder (EDR) can be analyzed to correlate rig activities with power usage, enabling improvements in drilling efficiency and power management. Using AI changes the paradigm, making it possible to proactively forecast and deliver the correct amount of power to the rig as demand changes throughout the drilling process.  This paper delves into the application of AI and automation of the power generation system to demonstrate its impact in revolutionizing drilling operations by forecasting and delivering power needs to deliver efficient drilling programs that use less fuel, produce lower emissions, extend equipment service life, and make fewer demands on the driller and rig crew.}

	abstract		= {To drill deeper and hotter wells, such as for high temperature high pressure (HPHT) oil and gas or geothermal applications, proper management of bottomhole temperatures is critical to ensure survival of electronic tools and to improve drilling performance. The paper introduces a new type of the Insulated Drill Pipe (the ``IDP'') which minimizes heat transfer from the annulus into the drill pipe, to deliver drilling fluid to the bottomhole assembly (BHA) with substantially cooler circulating temperature than using the non-insulated drill pipe.  An iterative design process was followed to develop a robust and cost-effective insulating material that can be applied to the inside and outside of the standard non-insulated drill pipe. After testing a series of different insulating materials in the lab and in the field as prototypes, a new coating system was chosen for the first generation of the IDP. Concurrently, a detailed thermal model was developed to estimate the expected cooling effect of the IDP.  A full IDP string was manufactured in 2022 and was subsequently used in three field trials: a geothermal test well in New Mexico, the USA DOE FORGE project in Utah, and a US-based shale well. During field trials, mud inlet and outlet temperatures and measurement while drilling (MWD) temperatures were monitored. In some cases, mud chillers were used at the surface to decrease the inlet mud temperature. Both real-time and recorded MWD temperatures were obtained. At FORGE, recorded circulating temperatures at the MWD were reduced by up to 42 \textdegree{}C (75 \textdegree{}F), from 107 \textdegree{}C (225 \textdegree{}F) to 65 \textdegree{}C (150 \textdegree{}F) in formation temperatures exceeding 150 \textdegree{}C (300 \textdegree{}F). Analysis of wear and robustness of the insulating material were inspected on all joints of drill pipe and damage in vertical and deviated wells was minimal. High normal forces and friction in a horizontal well did result in significant damage to the coating which can be remedied through improved coating design. The thermal model was validated with the measured data and used to accurately predict the performance of IDP in future runs.  This is the first extended field trial of the IDP, and the results demonstrate the value of the IDP to reduce mud temperatures downhole. The IDP allows for improved cooling of the BHA components, particularly electronics, and extends the operating window of existing MWD, electronic equipment and other BHA tools to deeper and hotter environments. This is critical for the HPHT wells and for deep and hot geothermal wells, reducing the cost of the instrumented BHAs for these wells, while improving downhole tool reliability, and reducing a frequency of tripping operations due to downhole failures. The developed thermal model can also provide maximal connection times by estimating the rate of borehole heating while rig pumps are off.}

	abstract		= {High-temperature geothermal resources away from tectonic boundaries or geologic hotspots can be accessed by the drilling of deep wells through significant sections of basement rock. This paper evaluates the impact of rapid cooling on rock cutting process, and incorporates this effect as a part of potential drilling performance optimization.  Using data from a series of experiments conducted in a high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) drilling laboratory, we demonstrated that rapid cooling enhanced rates of penetration over 60\% in the 300+ \textdegree{}C hot dry rock utilizing a {PDC} bit or a roller cone bit. Drilling was performed in hard igneous rock samples, with the unconfined compressive strength over 200 MPa. Each sample was heated and confined to predetermined conditions, then drilled with controlled parameters. The drilling performance data was acquired for each experiment, complemented with dynamic in-situ temperature measurements, and visual assessment of rock samples before and after drilling. The rapid cooling effect on the rate of penetration was found to be a function of the temperature difference between the drilling fluid at the bit face and the rock sample temperatures.  Unlike previous studies on the Drilling Performance, which overlooked thermal effects, our research focuses on the synergy between rapid cooling and mechanical rock cutting process. This study provides a framework to understand and improve drilling performance for HPHT wells, including deep and hot geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Effective management of asset retirement obligations is a paramount objective for operators in the oil and gas industry. As the industry undergoes significant shifts in focus towards environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance, ensuring the efficient and thorough decommissioning of wells and the permanent sealing of potential reservoirs during plug and abandonment (P\\\&A) procedures has become imperative. Operators seek additional assurances both before and during the P\\\&A process to confirm the integrity of cement barriers and plugs, as well as the overall effectiveness of containment measures. (G. Ishmukhametova,2017)In the pursuit of achieving long-term integrity in well abandonment while optimizing the utilization of limited rig resources, operators must grasp the intricacies of potential flow paths. This knowledge is critical for the strategic placement of the most effective barriers to prevent any future environmental or safety risks associated with well abandonment.  One of the primary challenges in well abandonment is the possibility of annulus pressure or fluid flow at the surface resulting from barrier failures. While surface diagnostic techniques such as flow checks and gas or fluid sampling can provide valuable insights into the origins of leaks, they often fall short in precisely identifying the source and leak path with complete certainty. In most cases, this ambiguity hampers traditional methods for re-establishing cement barriers, such as cement squeezing, section milling, or casing expansion.}

	abstract		= {Drilling systems automation (DSA) involves multiple actors, each delivering functionality at different levels of automation, with system performance dependent on various input from human operators. Current automation classifications do not fully address the multi-agent nature of drilling operations. Marketing language in industry publications has also outstripped reality by boldly describing automated drilling operations as autonomous, leading to confusion. There is a need to define and include autonomous behavior in the taxonomy of drilling systems automation.  A completely autonomous system without direct human interaction may not be a practical goal. Classification into levels of automation for drilling applies to the union of all functions used in a particular operation, and their interaction with humans. Various developed taxonomies showing the transition from manual to highly automated systems use the construct: acquire/observe, assess/orient, decide and act. This paper presents and analyzes taxonomies for their applicability to drilling systems automation, and their use to describe the level of autonomy in this discipline, considering the multi-agent nature and weak observability of drilling operations requiring human consideration.  The authors initially collaborated under the SPE DSATS (Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section) to develop a classification applicable to drilling systems automation \textemdash{} and by extension, completions, intervention, and P\\\&A automation \textemdash{} in which autonomous systems are recognized. The classification distinguishes the multi-agent drilling environment in which one agent may be concerned with hole cleaning, another with automated trajectory drilling, and yet another with optimizing rate-of-penetration, all while acting interdependently.  Depending on the necessary collaboration between agents, this multi-agent construct can lead to a mixed-initiative autonomous system that is able to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the drilling environment. Drilling, however, also has an observability problem that necessitates a more stratified solution to taxonomy due to missing or lacking data and data attributes. This observability problem exists in both space and time: most measurements are at surface, some from the bottomhole assembly; the low bandwidth of traditional measurement-while-drilling telemetry methods delivers sparse measurements.  This paper recommends a taxonomy for drilling systems automation from an enterprise to an execution level that considers the observability problem, complexity, and uncertainty, delivering the necessary capability to accurately classify and address autonomy within drilling systems automation. This taxonomy will greatly reduce the chance of miscommunication regarding drilling system automation capabilities.  The complexity, uncertainty, and sparse observability inherent in drilling suggests that the levels of automation taxonomies adopted in other industries (aviation, automotive, etc.) may not appear directly applicable to drilling systems automation. However, the introduction of three levels of autonomous systems leaves the application of a drilling systems automation levels of taxonomy as an underlying model. A clearly communicated safe introduction of automated and autonomous drilling systems will directly benefit from this industry-specific taxonomy that recognizes the degree of needed human interaction at all levels across all interconnected systems.}

	abstract		= {As operators actively manage their costs of drilling, reducing cost in one area can increase it in another. Millions of horizontal feet drilled across North American shale basins has effectively eradicated existing drill pipe fleets. In addition, the rise of 5-1/2 inch variants in land-based Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells has made drill pipe more difficult and costly to replace, so keeping drill pipe in service for as long as possible is paramount to improving its total cost of ownership as well as to ameliorate the risk of replacement when supply chains preclude availability. In two continuous trials, drill pipe was protected using welded wear bands near the center of the tubes, with the downhole effect on the pipe carefully measured and analyzed.  Using a ground-breaking, low heat input welding process, protective weld material was applied to drill pipe tube bodies used in the Jonah Field and Midland Basin. These protected the most vulnerable areas of the tubes from wear and mitigated DBR/downgrade. The protected drill pipe was thoroughly inspected after being used in both the Jonah Field and Midland Basin, and relevant technical inputs were recorded for every run in the Jonah Field. Extensive measurements were taken of the wear bands run-over-run to evaluate their effectiveness throughout the trials.  The technical need for protected drill pipe was twofold, effective rock destruction when drilling through hard, abrasive sandstone coupled with the economic need to deliver 2-2.5-mile laterals. For the trials, inspections \textendash{} including dimensional, visual, Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI), and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) \textendash{} were completed on pipe following multiple lateral runs and wells. These data were used to measure and monitor material loss of both the wear bands and drill pipe body and indicated that the wear bands were effectively protecting the drill pipe while wearing at measurable rates. Revolutions, calculated side forces, and lithology were tracked on a run-to-run basis in the Jonah Field to assist with normalizing the measured wear rates and evaluating the effectiveness of the trial wear bands. All this revealed successful runs with the wear bands present.  The value of this improved welding method is that it extends the life of the drill pipe, significantly decreasing the total cost of ownership for operators. Although these trials were limited in scope, a meaningful ROI will be achieved at scale, with all or most of the drill pipe protected with the longest-lasting wear bands. Because the wear bands cost less than 25\% of a new joint of pipe and allow the pipe to last up to twice as long, this Return On Investment (ROI) is substantial.}

	abstract		= {Model-based engineering has become more prevalent in the drilling industry over the last few decades. While there is great value in using models, a realistic understanding of the types of problems that can be solved with models, the associated cost, and limitations is critical. Understanding these challenges will help facilitate communication, planning, and collaboration. This paper describes some of the challenges to understanding and ultimately automating drilling processes using models.  Examples of models used to solve industry problems are torque and drag, stick slip, surge and swab, drillstring dynamics, and many more. Models may be data-driven, or physics based, steady state or dynamic, high fidelity or reduced order for execution speed and clarity. To learn from a high-fidelity model, data must be collected and fed to the model and parameters estimated to reproduce the behavior of interest. Often there is not enough data to be certain of the relevant dynamics either because of aliasing or sparse sensor placement. Models for control systems and automation must be controllable and observable which means that most of the high frequency dynamics which represent things like high frequency torsional oscillations and whirl are eliminated, high fidelity is not appropriate. Specifying model requirements and modifying existing models to meet those may require a significant effort which should be considered when planning projects.  The goal is to provide an overview of common use cases for models, and a general description of associated model requirements, to illustrate some of the challenges and costs involved in drilling automation. Processes involved in developing models for specific applications are not described in detail. Instead, the reader is referred to relevant literature.}

	abstract		= {The drilling and completion of oil and gas wells is a collaborative business, involving employees from many contractors working together. Well construction generates many documents that are shared cross-functionally between these different groups. A regulator may receive an as-drilled plat from a well planner, using surveys from an MWD operator, based on a pipe tally from a rig contractor. In this scenario, the person legally specifying the well location has likely never physically seen the wellhead or the equipment used to define the location. The regulatory database might later be used by a different operator for identifying offset wells on a nearby drilling program, further confounding matters. While document sharing is critical for successful well construction, there is often little opportunity for verification before use or transmission to another party.  A review of documents related to well construction was performed. This included plats, well plans, bottom hole assembly reports, directional surveys, and other drilling records. The examination was performed on which data was contained in these documents, how it might be verified by a third party using it, and the potential for errors to arise when the data is received or transmitted. Of particular concern were documents such as well locations and directional surveys which are not only difficult to verify but are also likely to be further shared with additional parties. These documents are frequently the basis for critical decisions related to well construction, implying a strong potential for erroneous data to be used when making those decisions.  For most of the document types investigated, there was little to no standardization on the content or format of the data presented. Similarly, when documents contained redundant data (such as a well name across a directional survey record, bottom hole assembly reports, and well plans) there was often inconsistency in how that data was presented. While in many cases the accuracy of the data may still be unverifiable, several good practices for identifying gross errors in documentation and preventing erroneous data from entering a curated database are presented. Examples include ensuring personnel are trained in the significance of the data being received and requesting redundant data whenever possible so internal cross-validation can be performed for data consistency.  Data quality processes for internal workflows have long been a focus for the industry. As more systems become increasingly connected, a similar amount of attention must be paid to external workflows, where if care is not taken data of unknown and unverifiable quality may be used to make critical decisions.}

	abstract		= {During well planning, specifying the separation that must be maintained from offset wellbores is critical to ensuring safe operations. Recent efforts on API RP 78, an upcoming recommended practice for wellbore placement, have provided guidelines for calculating safe separation distances and engineering considerations for those calculations. A major milestone was the publication of a separation rule (Sawaryn, et al. 2019) standardizing a formula for separation factor (SF), which in turn defines the minimum allowable separation distance (MASD) between two wellbores and the allowable deviation from plan (ADP) for a wellbore being drilled. One element of this formula, $\sigma{}$pa, describes the accuracy with which a future wellpath can be predicted. Prior guidance provides a suggested value for $\sigma{}$pa (1.6ft or 0.5m at 1-sigma) based on heuristics. A more rigorous approach for estimating this value is presented, where the design of the drilling program can be considered.  A framework is proposed for modeling deviation from a projected path using a planned trajectory, bottom hole assembly (BHA) properties, and survey practices. The method identifies where a deviation is detected through survey measurements and estimates a planned recovery operation. Equations are provided for estimating the distance from plan at deviation detection along with the maximum expected deviation during recovery. Common drilling scenarios are analyzed for sensitivity to operational parameters such as survey course length, sensor offset, toolface control, and BHA performance. The impact of varying $\sigma{}$pa is explored across prototypical collision avoidance cases. A discussion of the relationships between the $\sigma{}$pa value and the common collision avoidance calculations such as SF, MASD, and ADP is included along with considerations for the design of a risk management policy.  Survey course length, survey sensor offset and uncertainty in directional performance are all shown to have a significant impact on the potential maximum deviation from plan. An additional factor considered is the aggressiveness expected when performing recovery operations. An analysis of common drilling scenarios suggests the previously provided guidance of 1.6ft at 1-sigma appears suitable for cases where the directional behavior of the BHA is well characterized and the combination of course length and survey sensor offset is kept to 150ft or less. Longer survey course lengths, larger sensor offsets, or uncertainty in directional performance of the BHA can produce larger $\sigma{}$pa values, in some scenarios causing a significant impact on the MASD and ADP.  Previous work has called attention to the uncertainty in drilling to a projection, but up to now there has not been a rigorous method for estimating that quantity. With the methods outlined in this paper well planners and drilling engineers can make more informed decisions on how to ensure safe separation practices in their own operations.}

	abstract		= {Battery energy storage systems (ESS) have been proven to significantly reduce emissions and fuel consumption on drilling rigs since the industry's first system was deployed in 2018. These systems leverage their stored energy to reduce the number of generators online and operate the remaining generators at high load where they are most efficient. Control methodology has traditionally required at least one generator to be online to follow the grid formed by the generator(s) and bias the load higher or lower. However, during operations where power demand is lower than the capacity of a single generator, the battery becomes fully charged leaving the system with no mechanism to artificially increase generator load. This results in a single generator running at low load for extended periods of time.  A new automated energy-saving feature, characterized by the absence of ambient noise typically associated with generators, was developed to address this issue and create opportunities for additional fuel and emissions reductions. When the system determines that the operation will not require significant power consumption for an extended period, it will automatically initiate a shutdown of the last online generator and switch to the automated energy-saving mode, using only the batteries to form the electrical grid and supply power to all rig equipment. The rig will continue to operate in this mode until the battery state of charge drops to a certain threshold, at which point it will automatically launch a generator. When the additional generator comes online, it will run at a high load for a brief period to quickly recharge the battery. This accomplishes both goals of reducing generator runtime and increasing average generator load.  A calculated approach was necessary to maximize the time in the energy-saving mode while avoiding any impact to operations. Additionally, the control scheme was designed to minimize the number of generator starts while taking precautions to stay within the discharge limitations of the batteries. This feature was deployed to the fleet of ESS, resulting in additional fuel and emissions savings not possible with the traditional systems. Factors including ambient temperature and the operator-specific drilling program produced a wide range of efficiency improvement across the fleet.}

	abstract		= {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has become a critical strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and achieving environmental sustainability. In-situ stress determination plays a pivotal role in the success of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) initiatives. It is a fundamental component of ensuring the safe and reliable containment of captured carbon dioxide within underground storage reservoirs by enhancing the integrity and stability of reservoirs, minimizing the risk of potential leakage, and optimizing the placement and design of new CO2 injection wells. In summary, in-situ stress determination serves as the cornerstone of secure and effective CCS operations, underlining the critical importance of comprehensive geomechanical assessments for a sustainable carbon reduction strategy.  In this integrated approach, we conduct comprehensive stress testing measurements and integrate them with various openhole log measurements, including acoustics, imaging, caliper data, geomechanical analysis. The integrated workflow is designed to assess both the near-wellbore and far-field environment by analyzing axial, radial, and azimuthal waveforms recorded by borehole acoustics tools. Notably, variations in radial shear slowness serve as indicators of stress concentrations around the borehole, allowing for the estimation of stress magnitudes within anisotropic sandstone bodies. Multi-arm caliper and image analysis are crucial components of the stress testing process, providing insights into stress regime and direction. To further refine our stress testing, dynamic stress tests were conducted, offering valuable calibration data for minimum horizontal stress estimation. The accuracy of our workflow is validated through the analysis of pre- and post-stress test image logs.  In recent times, there has been a growing trend in incorporating mechanical earth models (MEM) into the assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage feasibility. These models play a pivotal role in estimating the integrity of the cap rock for CO2 storage and conducting feasibility studies for hydraulic fracturing to enhance injectivity. The integration of MEM into our workflow facilitates a comprehensive analysis of subsurface conditions, enabling informed decisions regarding CO2 storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. These methods are instrumental in accurately assessing the level of horizontal stress, a verification process that involves rigorous leakoff tests, formation integrity tests, and an analysis of microfracturing results.  This study highlights the significant potential of this integrated approach for in-situ stress characterization in CCS formations. It not only contributes to safer and more efficient carbon storage but also offers a foundation for informed decisions regarding wellbore stability and hydraulic fracturing operations, critical elements in the success of CCS initiatives. Ultimately, the integration of stress testing with acoustic logs, borehole image logs, and geomechanical models represents a robust strategy for achieving a comprehensive understanding of subsurface stress, addressing a fundamental aspect of CCS implementation.}

It provides a pathway to overcome labeled data shortage and field data quality limitations.  Labeled bit wear data is usually limited because only the final bit dull state can be labeled using dull photos for the entire drilling distance. To overcome this difficulty, an encoder-decoder unsupervised ML framework based on Bi-directional LSTM architecture is first applied to the data of entire drilling distance to extract and maximize data learnings. Then, a physics-based wear estimator is implemented in the learned latent space to augment labeled wear dataset, guided by true wear labels and offset-well data. Weighting factor in loss function is applied to optimize augmented and true datasets in final supervised learning step.  The proposed real-time bit wear model is built on a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning method. The model is applied on multiple field bit runs. Results show that by implementing the unsupervised data learnings only, the prediction accuracy is improved by 30\% compared to the baseline ML model. By combining physics-based augmentation, the accuracy is further improved by 10\%. More importantly, adding physics-based data augmentation significantly reduces prediction variance and unphysical wear outputs, therefore improving prediction stability by more than 30\%. It should be noted that the prediction stability of AI/ML model is crucial in real-time application and decision making. The results show physics-based data augmentation not only increases the size of label dataset and prevents model overfitting, but also applies physics-based guidance to the ML model effectively. It is learned weighting factor plays a crucial role in balancing loss contributions from true wear labels and physics-based labels. While low weighting factor of physics-based labels diminishes the augmented data, high weighting factor disrespects the true wear labels leading to a high prediction bias. Overall, the bit wear model study shows physic-based data augmentation combined with unsupervised data learning can effectively improve model accuracy, stability, and overcome labeled data shortage difficulty.  The proposed paper shows a case study for the bit wear ML model using a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning. While labeled data is one of the major challenges of ML models in many drilling applications, this study provides a pathway to improve both accuracy and stability of deep ML models with limited labeled data.}

	abstract		= {Downhole vibrations can lead to significant drilling problems in unconventional wells, such as frequent tool failures that increase drilling costs. Detecting these vibrations during drilling is crucial for enhancing drilling practices. One of the most destructive types of downhole vibrations is torsional stick-slip, characterized by fluctuations in bit rotation speed between zero and several times the surface rotation speed. Typically, surface data is used for real-time diagnosis of this drilling dysfunction. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based detection algorithms have increasingly been proposed in the literature.  However, a key drawback of AI methods is their limited applicability to wells in the same field with similar geological formations and bottom-hole assemblies (BHAs). This paper aims to address this limitation and explore solutions for generalizing these approaches. It does so by employing appropriate data normalization methods, transfer learning, and the inclusion of physics-based features. Using historical offset well data, this paper presents trained and tested machine learning models capable of predicting the stick-slip index (SSI) using sequences of surface measurements and physical features. This model can be deployed in real-time on drilling rigs to provide diagnostics and recommendations.}

	abstract		= {In today's well construction operations, a substantial volume of data is generated and stored across multiple databases. The primary objective being to use them as a guide for future well construction optimization. However, much of this data gets lost in computer storage, and appropriate information is difficult to find at the right time. This paper shows the results of deploying a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) large language model on an operator's dataset to alleviate this problem.  The process starts with gathering all relevant data into a common database. In this case, the dataset included sensor data, processed data, morning reports, end of well reports, after-action reviews of non-productive times, bit forensics data and publicly available data from wells drilled by other operators. The files were pre-processed, and metadata was added appropriately to ensure appropriate indexing and training of the information. This data is then fed to the cloud platform on which the model is learnt. The model is then integrated into the data platform so that the end users can pose queries.  The dataset consisted of more than 200 wells of the operator in a region that the operator is actively drilling. Data curation was a time-consuming task that had to be performed to ensure only quality and organized information was fed to the model. Documents containing well construction related subject matter were also used in the training to provide the end user assistance with core concepts. During the test stage, a multitude of questions were posed to the platform, including questions such as: What happened the last time there was a stuck pipe in this region? What is the best ROP that could be attained in the lateral section? Significant time savings were recorded due to the ease with which information could be retrieved. A big concern was the potential for wrongs answers being provided to the questions. To alleviate this concern, all answers were accompanied by references found in the database, to give the person reviewing the answers confidence in the answers.  This paper introduces the benefits that large language models (LLMs) bring to both well planning and real-time operations. LLM offers the capability to be able to retrieve information extremely quickly and provide answers in a conversational format to user questions. This paper also provides recommendations to the industry and details some of the challenges to adopting LLMs.}

	abstract		= {It is challenging to optimize operation procedures that safely remove riser gas without causing equipment, personnel, or unnecessary environmental issues. This paper presents results from studies of various scenarios using a fixed-choke constant outflow (FCCO) method that will keep the choke opening constant to measure fluid outflow while circulating the riser gas out through the booster line.  A commercial dynamic multiphase flow software program was used to study extreme scenarios of up to 300 bbl of gas influx in the bottom of the riser of a deepwater rig equipped with a riser gas handling system or managed pressure drilling (MPD) system drilling in 12,000 ft of water. The consequences of gas migration and free gas dissolution into both water-based and oil-based mud were studied. The initial fixed-choke opening was selected by modeling a 500-gal/min flow rate through the boost line with a choke sized to initially obtain from 150 to 200 psi surface back pressure. The pump rate was reduced to 200 gal/min or even 0 gal/min as needed to keep choke pressure; hence, the return flow rate is relatively equal to the initial target value. Other scenarios with different influx volumes and choke openings were also studied to check pressure consequences to the riser system.  When using the FCCO method to manage the 300 bbl influx with water-based mud, the software calculated a maximum pressure of 580 psi on the riser top. When using oil-based mud, a maximum pressure of 1,112 psi was observed on the riser top for the same scenario. When the same situation was simply shut in (instead of being circulated using the FCCO method), there was a maximum pressure of 2,300 psi on the riser top with water-based mud, but only 1,254 psi when using oil-based mud, ignoring for the moment the benefit provided by pressure relief valves in an actual operation, which could intervene before the riser top pressure reaches 2,300 psi.  The analysis of the resulting surface choke pressure and surface gas/liquid flow rate support the concept that circulation of the gas influx while adjusting pump rate to keep the flow rate constant through a choke at the fixed position (even if it means reducing the pump rate to 0 gal/min as flow is driven by gas expansion alone) would be easier to handle than by using other proposed riser gas management procedures.  This paper presents the first study of riser gas handling in an oil-based mud scenario considering gas dissolution with an FCCO and provide references for International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) riser-gas handling guidelines and deepwater well control guidelines.}

	abstract		= {Wells with compromised integrity can cause groundwater/soil contamination and increased carbon emissions. Given that there are more than 3.7 million abandoned wells in existence, preventative and remedial operations will need to be prioritized based on the current and future state of well integrity. Well integrity risk assessment, therefore, plays a critical role in managing abandoned wells. This paper presents a generalized workflow for risk assessment that can be applied to abandoned wells in any region.  This study introduces a data-based workflow to project wells onto a risk contour map with a leaking risk gradient as an indicator. The methodology calls for utilizing various feature-rich datasets obtained from multiple sources. Two datasets were used in this study for the purpose of demonstration, including a publicly available dataset consisting of 2342 wells and a newly collected dataset containing detailed information on 1047 wells in the San Juan Basin in the State of New Mexico. The inputs considered for the risk assessment model based on machine learning (ML) included well longitude, latitude, total injected or produced fluid throughout the well's lifetime, distance to induced seismic activity, well lifespan (age), TVD, surface casing bottom depth, production casing bottom depth, completion length, oil price, sacks of cement used to cement the surface casing, abandonment date, cement thickness, and target geologic reservoir formation. Five ML models (artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting classifier, and logistic regression) were trained, with the artificial neural network classifier showing the best performance with an initial 75\% accuracy. This artificial neural network model was re-trained for regression, which allowed manual threshold setting. This increased the prediction accuracy to 85\%. A leaking risk contour map with risk gradient indicators was created by applying the artificial neural network regression model.  This approach provides an essential tool for guidance on wells with compromised well integrity that need to be permanently abandoned or re-abandoned, and wells with sufficient long-term well integrity such that they can be considered for re-use and re-purposing as wastewater / CO2 / hydrogen storage wells, geothermal wells, gravitational energy battery wells, etc. This issue is particularly important given the large asset retirement obligations (ARO) faced by oil and gas operators, presenting major capital expenditures with little-to-no return on investment (ROI) if all wells are to be abandoned. Considerable ARO reduction may be achieved if wells with sufficient integrity can be re-purposed.  Reducing uncertainties associated with well integrity and generating a risk contour map provides valuable insight for asset management of wells to be either abandoned or repurposed and empowers decision-makers to prioritize resources efficiently. This paper provides an easily reproducible data-based approach for identifying wells with different well integrity risk profiles. This paper also highlights features that should almost always be considered in any well-integrity study.}
