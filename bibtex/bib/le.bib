	abstract		= {This paper addresses the dynamic stability of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits under induced torsional and lateral vibrations. Dynamic stability is investigated by considering three simple mechanical systems representing string-torsional vibration, bit-lateral dynamics, and coupled torsional-lateral vibration of the bit-string assembly. For each system, the rotary-speed (rev/min)/ weight-on-bit (WOB) domain within which the system is dynamically stable is determined. The influence of various drillstring and bit parameters on the stability of bit motion is studied through their effect on the size of the stability zone on (rev/min)/WOB plots. These illustrate the power of the stability approach in providing valuable qualitative information on the main parameters influencing bit stability.}

The model is three-dimensional (3D) and consists of the idealization of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) into a number of finite elements. Inertia properties are included to predict the transient dynamic behavior of the assembly during drilling. To ensure the correct boundary condition at the bit/rock interface, two rock/bit interaction models, one for a roller-cone bit and one for a polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit, are developed.}

	abstract		= {This paper recommends standardized names and equations for the two most common uses of Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) concepts: ``Total MSE'' and "Downhole MSE". These names and their equations should be used uniformly in all applications, including electronic drilling recorder (EDR) pick lists, rig site surveillance, engineering surveillance, data analytics, research, and technical publications.Mechanical Specific Energy, used as a metric for drilling efficiency, is a mathematical calculation of the energy used per volume of rock drilled. The Downhole MSE equation calculates the efficiency of the bit alone, while the Total MSE equation includes both the bit and drill string. Those who use MSE in surveillance or analytics know the negative effects created by the lack of standardization over the years; it is certainly not a new problem.The lack of standardized nomenclature has resulted in the use of the same name for different equations, or different names are given two equations that are identical. This affects the ability of drill teams to engage vendors in redesign of performance limitations or to communicate new operational practices between teams or rigs. In addition, this standard corrects a mathematical error that is common in calculating the Total MSE.The concen with the inconsistencies has increased as MSE has become a key element in many automated optimization schemes. Inconsistencies or uncertainties in the basis of MSE values calculated in real time or shared in large data sets will affect the industry's ablity to develop useful analytics or to automate rig control platforms and data-driven decisions.This paper also includes a discussion of the MSE measurement errors and their effect on calculated values, which is of particular interest to controls engineers and those involved in data analytics. Examples are provided to illustrate how the two different MSE values are used in field operations. Also, a substantial reference list of current and potential future uses of MSE is included to encourage better MSE-based practices to potentially lead to the development of new uses in the future, including automation.This ad hoc MSE Standardization Committee is a volunteer group with representation from operators, rig contractors, service companies, and data acquisition vendors. The guidance given reflects there shared experienec in utilizing MSE in surveillance and analytics, and the recommended equations are technically correct.},

	abstract		= {Simulation of drilling processes involves the seamless integration of strongly coupled physics, numeric, and economic models. Operators desire advanced drilling simulation software that can mimic reality and yet be practical for daily operations. At the same time, academic researchers are devoting time and effort to develop robust and accurate models of every module of an integrated drilling environment but are challenged with translating their original contributions into the operational setting. We seek to solve both of these issues through a distinctive collaboration consortium based on an open-source paradigm. We describe and propose an advanced drilling simulation developed through a joint industry consortium at Texas A\&M University. The simulator provides free access to sophisticated and reliable drilling dynamics solvers. This includes drill string dynamics, torque and drag analysis, geologic modeling, hydraulics, and wellbore pressure modeling, visualization, and operator interfaces. The simulator is written in C++ and is built on top of high-performance open source libraries that leverages parallel computing, GPU acceleration, multibody, and computational fluid dynamics solvers as well as other tools (see figure for further details). We will assist industry and academic users to employ our open-source tool. In addition, we will help said parties further develop our framework into proprietary and protected business software via the addition of custom functionality. The simulator core was successfully developed and has been used to model horizontal drilling, while providing near real-time performance. The framework has been used in several applications successfully, including modeling shallow horizontal jetting, rock drilling, and steering; as well as reconstructing spatial data from high fidelity downhole signals for borehole evaluation, and the development of improved downhole navigation algorithms. We believe that a collaborative development effort between academia and industry will bring solutions to complex modeling needs faster and more economically than any individual endeavor. To this end, the authors will also show how one can partner with Texas A\&M University to obtain access to the open-source enabled drilling simulation framework and platform to collaborate, improve and create solutions for new and existing problems.},

Although T\&D software has existed for over 20 years, some confusion still exists over the validity of the models used to characterize drilling and completion operations. This paper provides an assessment of current limitations of the various T\&D models (soft-string and stiff-string) and appraises their validity. Field data from various operations is used to illustrate certain limitations. The paper defines future requirements for what is considered to be the next generation of T\&D models. Probably the most important technical requirement is a more realistic stiff-string model to correctly account for the impact of tubular stiffness, hole clearance and tortuosity effects.},

	abstract		= {This paper describes a new approach to understand the causes of stick-slip vibrations experienced by PDC bits. This new model takes into consideration not only the axial and torsional modes of vibration, but also the coupling between these two modes through bit-rock interaction laws, which are consistent with laboratory results from single cutter experiments. These interaction laws, which account for both frictional contact and cutting processes at the bit-rock interface, are formulated in terms of the depth of cut, a variable that brings into the equations the position of the bit at a previous a priori unknown time. They also account for potential loss of frictional contact between the wear-flats and the rock. The delayed and coupled nature of this interaction is ultimately responsible for the occurrence of self-excited vibrations, which can degenerate into stick-slip oscillations under certain conditions. The features of the torsional vibrations that are predicted with this model are well in accordance with field observations. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model predicts apparent rate effects as an inherent outcome of the nature of the bit-rock interface.}

The results of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experiments conducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the details of the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certain of the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematical model can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which the torque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gouging action of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indenting action of the teeth.}

Rock ductility is identified as a major influence on bit performance. Cone offset is recognized as an important design feature. Each roller bit style is characterized via a laboratory drilling procedure. Mechanical behavior is characterized via triaxial compression tests. The model relates these factors to predict the drilling response of each bit. The roller bit model provides two modes of field application. First, field data can be interpreted to generate a continuous rock strength log. The rock strength log can then be utilized to predict and interpret roller bit performance in offset wells.}
