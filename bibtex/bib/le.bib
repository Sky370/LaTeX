The model is three-dimensional (3D) and consists of the idealization of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) into a number of finite elements. Inertia properties are included to predict the transient dynamic behavior of the assembly during drilling. To ensure the correct boundary condition at the bit/rock interface, two rock/bit interaction models, one for a roller-cone bit and one for a polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit, are developed.}

This new model takes into consideration not only the axial and torsional modes of vibration, but also the coupling between these two modes through bit-rock interaction laws, which are consistent with laboratory results from single cutter experiments. These interaction laws, which account for both frictional contact and cutting processes at the bit-rock interface, are formulated in terms of the depth of cut, a variable that brings into the equations the position of the bit at a previous a priori unknown time. They also account for potential loss of frictional contact between the wear-flats and the rock. The delayed and coupled nature of this interaction is ultimately responsible for the occurrence of self-excited vibrations, which can degenerate into stick-slip oscillations under certain conditions. The features of the torsional vibrations that are predicted with this model are well in accordance with field observations. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model predicts apparent rate effects as an inherent outcome of the nature of the bit-rock interface.}

The results of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experiments conducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the details of the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certain of the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematical model can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which the torque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gouging action of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indenting action of the teeth.}

Rock ductility is identified as a major influence on bit performance. Cone offset is recognized as an important design feature. Each roller bit style is characterized via a laboratory drilling procedure. Mechanical behavior is characterized via triaxial compression tests. The model relates these factors to predict the drilling response of each bit. The roller bit model provides two modes of field application. First, field data can be interpreted to generate a continuous rock strength log. The rock strength log can then be utilized to predict and interpret roller bit performance in offset wells.}
