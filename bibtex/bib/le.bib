	abstract		= {A distributed model of a drill string is presented, with Coulomb stiction as a distributed source term, to investigate the effect of borehole inclination and borehole friction on the incidence of torsional vibrations along a drill-string. To isolate the effect of this distributed friction, only cases where the bit is off bottom and with no axial movement are considered, and consequently a purely torsional model is used. The model is used to study the stick slip limit cycle, as caused by distributed Coulomb friction, and the limit-cycle period and amplitude dependence on the friction parameters is derived. This enables the qualitative limit-cycle behavior to be characterized as inertia or stick dominated, and examples of this characterization is validated with the field data. For comparison, high frequency field data from two deviated wells from surface and downhole sensors are considered. Time-series are isolated where angular rotation is restarted after a connection, with the bit off bottom and before axial motion is re-initiated, to make the data consistent with the model assumptions. A close match is obtained between recorded and modeled downhole data, however, in some cases either the initial torsional strain in the drillstring is not known or axial motion is initiated, which violates model assumptions, causing a mismatch.}

	abstract		= {This paper addresses the dynamic stability of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits under induced torsional and lateral vibrations. Dynamic stability is investigated by considering three simple mechanical systems representing string-torsional vibration, bit-lateral dynamics, and coupled torsional-lateral vibration of the bit-string assembly. For each system, the rotary-speed (rev/min)/ weight-on-bit (WOB) domain within which the system is dynamically stable is determined. The influence of various drill string and bit parameters on the stability of bit motion is studied through their effect on the size of the stability zone on (rev/min)/WOB plots. These illustrate the power of the stability approach in providing valuable qualitative information on the main parameters influencing bit stability.}

	abstract		= {The use of lubricants is commonplace when drilling with water-based drilling fluids. They are less frequently applied when drilling with non-aqueous fluids, as the oil-based drilling fluid is thought to impart a high lubricity.  With increased reach of the wells, lubricants are also applied in non-aqueous fluids (NAF) to reduce torque and drag at high angle, for extended reach and horizontal wells to improve drilling efficiency. However, the performance of these lubricants in NAF at extended periods of elevated temperature at downhole conditions is often inconsistent, thought to be hampered by ineffective metal binding and hydrolytic instability of the lubricant molecule. This requires frequent re-dosing and therefore higher cost to maintain performance.  In order to identify a better-performing lubricant, it was necessary to better understand the fundamentals of lubrication in a drilling fluid. For example, what portion of the well contributes most to torque and drag? What is the frictional regime that dominates the lubricity between a drill pipe and its contact points?Looking at theoretical analysis and modeling, it was found that the horizontal portion is dominated by the boundary and mixed layer friction regime, which is a combination of surface forces and fluid viscosity. Additionally, understanding of tribology from other industrial applications was employed to better design a molecule that can deliver optimum lubricity in a NAF.  This new understanding led to identifying an optimized lubricant for NAF. A lubricant derived from a plant-based raw material was specifically designed to be chemically and thermally stable, binding strongly to metal surfaces, and providing a tenacious film that reduces metal-to-metal friction factors during drilling, casing run and other completion operations.  The identified lubricant was tested for compatibility with NAF, including effects on rheology, elastomers, and formation damage potential. Coefficients of friction and fluid rheology comparisons and research-related field trials are presented. The results show significant (20\%) reduction in the coefficient of friction after treatment, especially after hot-rolling, indicating thermal and oxidative stability of the product.}

	abstract		= {A major challenge that is being occasionally faced during the well construction phase is to cement the formations holding narrow pressure margins between the pore and fracture gradients without inducing losses. Losses can commonly occur in these cases, compromising the integrity of the cement barrier. Designed slurry densities generally lead to high equivalent circulating density (ECD) levels during the cementing operations. This condition, combined with mud weights conventionally designed to be above pore pressure, usually results in downhole pressures which approach or exceed the fracture limit. Commonly, operators implement strategies to mitigate losses during the cementing phase, however, in most cases the losses are unavoidable using a conventional cementing approach. Managed pressure cementing (MPC) is an important technique for primary cementing operations in wells with such narrow pressure margins.  This paper presents the design considerations, methodology and results of a land well where high-pressure influx was encountered while drilling an 8-3/8-in hole across a water-bearing formation. Narrow pressure gradient persuaded to utilize managed pressure drilling (MPD) to continue the drilling. The well was drilled to the target depth using 138-lbm/ft3 oil-based drilling fluid while maintaining the ECD from 146.5 to 149.5 lbm/ft3. Careful attention was paid to estimate the bottom hole circulating temperature, using the temperature modeling simulator. A 150-lbm/ft3 slurry was designed to keep the ECD intact. The slurry was batch-mixed to ensure the homogeneity of the final slurry mixture. A special spacer system was designed to reduce the losses while cementing. Additionally, the spacer was loaded with optimum amounts of surfactant package to serve as an aid to remove the mud and to water-wet the formation and pipe for better cement bonding. The centralizers placement plan was optimized, and additionally the liner was rotated during the cement job to achieve the required displacement efficiency yet staying within the torque and drag (T\&D) limits. The cement treatment was performed as designed and met all zonal isolation objectives.  The managed pressure cementing (MPC) system provides safe isolation of problematic zones in cost effective manner even in challenging narrow pressure window scenarios. The system provides precise control of the pressure and flow during and after the cement job. Constant pressure can be achieved at weak zones, preventing losses to the formation.  This case study presents an overview of the engineering process used to plan and design the MPC operations and the results obtained. This paper reviews a successful MPC operation and presents findings and lessons learnt. After the successful results on this job and subsequent operations, this technique is now being adopted to optimize cementing, where losses during cementing operations in the past had forced to modify the well construction.}

	abstract		= {There is considerable value in automatically quantifying cutter damage from drill bit pictures. Current approaches do not classify cutter damage by type, i.e., broken, chipped, lost, etc. We, therefore, present a computer vision model using deep learning neural networks to automate multi-type damage detection in Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill bit cutters.  The automated bit damage detection approach presented in this paper is based on training a computer vision model on different cutter damage types aimed at detecting and classifying damaged cutters directly. Prior approaches detected cutters first and then classified the damage type for the detected cutters. The You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm was selected based on the findings of an earlier published study. Different models of YOLOv5 were trained with different architecture sizes with various optimizers using two-dimensional (2D) drill bit images provided by the SPE Drilling Uncertainty Prediction technical section (DUPTS) and labeled by the authors with training from industry subject matter experts. To achieve the modeling goal, the images were first annotated and labeled to create training, validation, and testing sub-datasets. Then, by changing brightness and color, the images allocated for the training phase were augmented to generate more samples for the model development. The categories defined for labeling the DUPTS dataset were bond failure, broken cutter, chipped cutter, lost cutter, worn cutter, green cutter, green gauge, core out, junk damage, ring out, and top view. These categories can be updated once the IADC upgrade committee finishes upgrading IADC dull bit grading cones.  Trained models were validated using the validation dataset of 2D images. It showed that the large YOLOv5 with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer achieved the highest metrics with a short training cycle compared to the Adam optimizer. In addition, the model was tested using an unseen data set collected from the local office of a drill bit supplier. Testing results illustrated a high level of performance. However, it was observed that inconsistency and quality of rig site drill bit photos reduce model accuracy. Therefore, it is suggested that companies produce large sets of quality images for developing better models. This study successfully demonstrates the integration of computer vision and machine learning for drill bit grading by categorizing/classifying damaged cutters by type directly in one stage rather than detecting the cutters first and then classifying them in a second stage. To guarantee the deployed model's robustness and consistency the model deployment has been tested in different environments that include cloud platform, container on a local machine, and cloud platform as a service (PaaS) with an online web app. In addition, the model can detect ring out and cored damages from the top view drill bit images, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this has not been addressed by any study before.  The novelty of the developed deep learning computer vision algorithm is the ability to detect different cutter damage types in a fast and efficient process compared to the current lengthy manual damage evaluation practice. Furthermore, the trained model can detect damages that frequently take place in more than one blade of the bit such as ring outs and coring. In addition, a user-friendly interface was developed that generates results in pdf and CSV file formats for further data analysis, visualization, and documentation. Also, all the technologies used in the development of the model are open source and we made our web app implementation open access.}

	abstract		= {Core analysis, if conducted successfully, can provide accurate assessment of the original reservoir fluid properties, however, it is challenging to retrieve an uncontaminated core, due to mud components contaminating the fluids originally present in the reservoir. Due to invasion, the liquid extracted from the cores, does not necessarily represent the native liquid, but rather a mixture of drilling and reservoir fluid, thus affecting the results, conclusions and decisions that were based on the analysis. Therefore, deploying advanced water-based mud (WBM) tracers, during coring operations, can mitigate this issue and lead to a significant cost-reduction in field development.  Tracer technology is an efficient monitoring and surveillance tool, that was proven to help in tracking and understanding the injection flow paths, and estimating the remaining oil saturation (Sor) in the reservoir, through inter-well and single-well tracer tests. Utilizing water-based tracers in the drilling mud, during coring operation, can help in quantifying the degree of invasion in the retrieved cores, therefore proper correction and more accurate assessment of the reservoir rock and fluid properties, can be made.  The accuracy of the data plays a pivotal role in guiding the way forward and the future development of oilfield projects. A WBM tracer was utilized in the drilling mud, during the sidetracking of an observation well at the first and largest CO2-Project in the middle east. The objective of sidetracking the well was to obtain sponge core samples to assess the residual oil saturation (ROS) and evaluate the sweep efficiency of the CO2-flood.  This report provides an overview of tracer technologies and the lessons learnt from deploying advanced water-based mud (WBM) tracers during the coring operation of a CO2 observation well, including theoretical and experimental considerations, engineering design and field test issues. The objective of this tracer survey was to estimate the invasion of the drilling mud-filtrate and correct water saturations. It will be useful to use this deployment in some of the relatively mature fields, however, it may have some limitations and challenges that need to be addressed first.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents the results of a study showing that the most harmful polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit vibrations can be attributed to a phenomenon called 'bit whirl.'  During whirl, the instantaneous center of rotation moves around the face of the bit, and the bit whirls backward around the hole. Cutters on a whirling bit can move sideways, backward, and much faster than those on a true rotating bit. The impact loads associated with this motion cause PDC cutters to chip, which, in turn, accelerates wear. Laboratory and field results show the detrimental effects of whirl on PDC bit rate of penetration (ROP) and life.}

	abstract		= {Currently, real-time adjustments to drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), drillstring revolutions per minute (RPM), flow rate, etc., are based primarily on experience. This is mainly due to the uncertain nature of information (both downhole and surface) available and inability of humans to aggregate multiple data streams in real-time to make optimal decisions. The objective therefore is to build a decision support tool that can overcome these limitations by automatically aggregating this data, identifying drilling inefficiency and suggesting optimal drilling parameters.  The methodology presented in this paper uses a Bayesian network to represent the drilling process and is capable of representing uncertainty in a way that is robust to bad sensor data. The model is updated in real-time and tracks variations in drilling conditions. Various dysfunctions such as bit balling, bit bounce, whirl, torsional vibrations, high mechanical specific energy (MSE), auto-driller erratic behavior, etc., are identified by tracking the movement characteristics of various sensor data in relation to model predicted values. A holistic drilling optimization index is thus derived by aggregating all this information. This index coupled with the drilling dysfunction prediction ultimately enables recommendation of drilling parameter corrections.  The drilling optimization index has been integrated into a drilling rig data aggregation system currently in operation on twenty rigs in North America. The system has access to real-time data, both at low frequency (less than 1 Hz) as well as data in the 1 to 10 Hz range, and also contextual data (such as data typically available in a tour sheet or well plan). In deploying the system, human factors aspects were given significant consideration. A typical driller is not familiar with concepts such as Bayesian networks, MSE, etc. By displaying the effectiveness of drilling as a single, dimensionless parameter, an index that varies between 0 and 1, with 0 representing inefficient drilling and 1 representing optimal drilling, the message is effectively communicated to the driller. The index is currently depicted in a very intuitive "speedometer" type of visual. Values are low and closer to 0 when dysfunctions occur, and when that happens suggestions are provided on how to mitigate the dysfunctions. These suggestions are visually presented in the form of operational cones in the WOB-RPM space. Additionally, the variation of the index with drilling depth is displayed to enable the driller to identify how formation changes impact drilling performance. This was found to be useful to drilling engineers who are generally tasked with optimizing the drilling process.},

	abstract		= {Inorganic geopolymers typically consist of aluminosilicate-rich powders and alkali silicate solutions as hardeners. When these components are mixed, geopolymers exhibit a behavior similar to that of cement. The final product leaves a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to conventional cement. This paper offers a comprehensive characterization of a granite-based geopolymer designed for oilfield applications, adhering to the standard tests specified by API RP 10B-2. It also highlights the advantages and current limitations of this innovative technology while identifying areas for further research and development.  This geopolymer has been specifically engineered to completely replace Ordinary Portland Cement in well cementing applications. We conducted a series of tests, following API standards, to evaluate its fluid-state properties, including viscosity, static gel strength, thickening time, static fluid-loss, free fluid, and density. Additionally, we examined its mechanical properties after solidification, such as sonic strength development, uniaxial compressive strength, and volume change. Our analysis of the granite-based geopolymer demonstrates the effective performance of the dispersant, reducing viscosity, and enhancing mixability. We observed a brief gel transition time upon setting, and the mix exhibited slight expansion during the strength development phase. Notably, strength development remained continuous and did not plateau even after 30 days of curing. These geopolymers combine high compressive strength with exceptional flexibility. Furthermore, temperature sensitivity analysis revealed that an 8ºC increase did not affect the gelation time.  This granite-based geopolymer is a cement-free system with a low calcium content, measuring less than 15\% by weight. It presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for replacing Portland cement in oil wells, both during well construction and abandonment. Moreover, it proves to be an excellent choice for constructing CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) and geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Tripping operations can take up a significant portion of well construction time and the associated cost. In the last decade, there has been extensive development and deployment of real-time tripping applications to optimize tripping parameters while maintaining formation integrity. This paper presents a system that utilizes transient modeling of tripping behavior to determine the optimum parameters that safeguard the integrity of the formation and the mechanical equipment at the rig site. The system delivers tripping boundaries to automated drilling control systems (ADCS) for every stand.  A digital twin of the wellbore, equipped with physics-based transient models, estimates the permissible axial velocities and accelerations developed when running drillstring in and out the wellbore. These motions develop pressure waves which travel along the wellbore and which can compromise formation integrity. The digital twin, prepared in the planning phase and deployed in the real-time drilling environment, uses smart triggering algorithms to automatically update the models and refine simulation results. Automation systems consume the predicted limits via an aggregation layer to refine fit-for-purpose tripping applications. The automation system finds optimum proposals of tripping limits and updates them directly in the rig control system in real-time.  The trip monitoring system automatically and continuously publishes optimum velocity and acceleration tripping limits per stand and transmits them as set points to the ADCS to define a safe operating envelope (SOE). This approach can greatly reduce the overall tripping time in comparison to non-automated deployments. Furthermore, the reduction of invisible lost time (ILT) takes place while maintaining the integrity of the formation, and the integrity of the surface equipment. Finally, reduction of the energy required to perform the tripping process consequently decreases the amount of carbon emissions involved in the process.  A set of case studies confirm the effectiveness of the approach and illustrate its benefits. A case study addresses the topic of adoption of drilling automation applications such as the tripping advisor. Another case presents the concept of interoperability using as example a deployment on a rig simulator setup in Europe to perform closed-loop control using the tripping application to write velocity and acceleration limits continuously to the ADCS.}

	abstract		= {Over the last years, the use of autonomous solutions for balancing the loading on the drill-bit has increased annually. By 2021, downhole tools for this purpose have been used for more than 1,500 wells and these become possibly the fastest growing trend in drilling. Polycrystaline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill-bits represent a great potential for drilling economics when steady cutting is attainable. Deep drilling, however, typically involves long drillstring causing an array of dynamic instabilities preventing steady cutting conditions at the bit. Such behavior affects drilling performance in terms of the rate-of-penetration (ROP) and system damage and failure. This leaves a big potential for improvement of drilling performance. The first experiments with an autonomous downhole regulator constructed were completed at Ulrigg in Stavanger almost twenty years ago to tap into this potential. Several versions of similar tools have since developed using a variety of mechanical and hydraulic functions to modify and shift the forces acting on the drill-bit in order to improve drilling performance.  The Norwegian operator Equinor has participated from the very start of this new automation trend. By 2020 they had deployed downhole regulators to a total of 93 well sections on the Norwegian Continental Shelf alone. In this paper, Equinor shares statistic plots from comparing these first 93 sections to well section with conventional BHA's. The data show how the continuous improvement of the regulator eventually led to gradual improvement of both ROP and footage - in addition to its initial task of reducing vibrations. By utilizing a variety of dynamic models, predictions and sensitivity analysis, it has been revealed that the downhole regulator could change the dynamic response of the bit such that the friction losses at the bit are reduced and the rock cutting efficiency is improved. In this paper, it is shown that such benefits can also be expected in real-life scenarios in which two key aspects play a role: 1) a PDC bit penetrating heterogeneous layers of rock formations, and 2) involving two frictional losses due to borehole - drillstring contact in deviated wells.  This paper brings a unique insight to the fundamentals, advanced mathematical models, and statistical results from a new line of drilling technology. The autonomous regulators bring a combination of reduction in risk and time to drill that makes a significant impact on cost.}

	abstract		= {Automated rig pump startup sequences are a common component of rig control systems (RCS) where the operator programs a sequence to the controller for its execution. This sequence is entered manually and it does not change unless the operator modifies it. The current paper presents a new approach towards pumps management, where the startup sequence is updated automatically for every new startup event, considering the current state of the equipment and the formation downhole.  A digital twin of the wellbore equipped with physics-based transient models calculates the hydraulic parameters to build the startup sequence for every pump startup event. The startup sequence is updated continuously and automatically while drilling using the current state of the formation and rig equipment as inputs. The sequence calculated by the digital twin in real-time is then transmitted to a hydraulics automation application to monitor the execution of the startup events. In addition, the hydraulics application can write the startup sequence to automated drilling control systems (ADCS) to execute the pump startup process using tailored sequences for every event.  The transient hydraulic model that enables the estimation of a safe and optimum pump startup sequence has been integrated into digital twins used during pre-job planning as well as in real-time deployments. The model successfully updates the startup sequence in response to changes in pressure limitations at surface and downhole. In addition, the model responds to changes in the gel formation process to adjust the startup sequence accordingly. Furthermore, the digital twin calculates the hydraulic limits to consider for an effective monitoring, such as the flow rate, surface pressure, flow rate gradient and pressure gradient at surface.  The calculated sequence and limits are transmitted to the hydraulics automation application, which monitors the execution of the startup sequence and calculates key performance indicators related to the process. This makes it possible to identify invisible lost time during startup operations. Furthermore, the startup sequence is exposed by the hydraulics automation application to ADCS to automate the execution of the startup and shutdown processes.  A case study from the North Sea confirms the effectiveness of the approach and illustrates its benefits. It illustrates the collaboration between multiple advisors and a single ADCS, when all features are deployed simultaneously in real-time, and then executed automatically by the ADCS. Four different applications were deployed in connection to the ADCS, namely the pump management application, tripping advisor, rate of penetration (ROP) optimization and stringer drilling (SD) advisor.  In contrast to mechanical automation practices, the proposed method automatically calculates a new sequence for the pumps for every new startup event, considering the pressure environment at surface and downhole. In addition, the sequence is transmitted to the ADCS for execution and real-time monitoring, closing the control loop to the equipment.}

	abstract		= {Drilling process automation has been a trending topic within the technical community, most recently discussed in SPE-212565-MS (Cayeux et al. 2023). Recovery control - specifically in the case of motor stalls - is not only integral to consistently completing automation control system execution, but also building confidence for the control system users and ultimate automation benefactors. Predicting, preventing, detecting, mitigating, and recovering motor stalls through automated recovery control solves an issue affecting most operators, contributing to additional bottom-hole assembly (BHA) damage and unplanned trips.  The recovery control system was designed with six major process control interfaces, two of which occur during on-bottom drilling: drilling while rotating and drilling while sliding. Each control interface is a means by which an external system can control the rig tools in a coordinated fashion, managing what control is currently active and ensuring the driller can ultimately assume control at any given time. The recovery control is customized and preconfigured with an observation window to execute the recovery process once the stall criteria has been breached while on-bottom drilling, sliding or rotating. The result is mitigated motor stalls that are consistently managed with a configurable automation system, less BHA damage, and no motor stall related unplanned trips - displaying both time and cost value.  After two years of testing the recovery control system internally, there were no undetected stalls, no false detections, and no unplanned trips due to motor stall, displaying detailed accuracy. The recovery control complements the process control, limit control, and manual control components of the automation control system to drill a stand effectively and consistently.  A complete and effective automation control system gives time back to the rig crew and allows for leadership development opportunities. The reliability gained through recovery control, faster than manual attempts, allows the driller to focus more time on safety and training the rig crew instead of monitoring differential pressure in the hopes of manually preventing a motor stall. In nearly all cases, stalls were detected faster with the automatic recovery control system compared to manual detection by the driller. Drillers cannot be expected to pay attention to the hundreds of potential drilling problems - a control system can.  There are systems claiming to identify motor stalls, but this recovery control is the only technology to date that actively detects and recovers the system from the stall.}

	abstract		= {The drilling industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, leading to increased efficiency, lower costs, and reduced emissions per production unit. As unconventional well construction complexity continues to increase, the next wave of innovation lies in process automation, offering improved consistency and the opportunity to enhance drilling engineering designs.  Effectively automating drilling a stand while minimizing human variability requires a scalable control system, providing adaptability, seamless implementation, and improved operational outcomes. The system requires high- and low-level process control components to effectively control rig machinery within the bounds of the machine limit controls. By using automation sequences while engaging and disengaging the drill bit, operational states such as breakover, optimal weight on bit (WOB), steady state hookload, and zeroing become easier to distinguish.  Through consistent implementation of process automation in drilling operations, the impact on operational outcomes became evident. Analysis of bit disengagement in a series of automatically drilled stands in the lateral revealed a consistent breakover range of 18 to 22 ft. This is particularly noteworthy as breakover is typically more challenging to identify and prone to variability in manual operations.  Zeroing WOB in the lateral at a predetermined drilling interval is common practice to calibrate the drilling system, and procedures provided by the operator are often conservative due to human variability resulting in slower process execution. While drilling automated stands in a lateral, it was determined the lowering sequence of the process could be reduced by half to effectively zero the WOB and differential pressure, reducing invisible lost time.  Not all invisible lost time and variability is human related; variability due to equipment design was reduced. Torquing drillpipe connections is essential to drilling a well. Development of high spec automated floor wrenches improved make-up connection torque accuracy and consistency primarily associated with fundamental tool design. These improvements led to a connection integrity paradigm shift, reducing manual tong usage by 99\%, effectively eliminating the need for high torque tongs at a wellsite, leading to improved tripping time and safety.  As drilling automation continues to evolve, the outcomes obtained through consistent process execution provide valuable insights. Additionally, this contributes to a decrease in emissions per unit of hydrocarbon production. Consistency through automation reveals new avenues for in-depth technical discussions on achieving safe and efficient drilling of progressively complex wells.}

	abstract		= {A previous paper (Bang, 2017) has described a general method for calculation of the probability of collision between two wellbores. The present paper focuses on the sections along both wells where the collision probability is significant. Our hypothesis for this study was that for such limited sections of the wellbores, approximations and alternative mathematical approaches might increase the computational efficiency without too large sacrifices of the result's accuracy.  The potential benefits have been investigated through numerical calculations. The results indicate that using a constant uncertainty instead of the actual, varying uncertainty across the entire close-proximity region may increase the computation efficiency. However, we also found that this approximation should be applied with care, because it may generally be difficult to define the constant uncertainty with sufficient accuracy, based on a priori data. Furthermore, we have evaluated the current method of calculating probabilities in metric space against calculating in Mahalanobis space. These two approaches are mathematically equivalent. For our implementation and limited range of testing, the two methods are about equal with respect to computation efficiency.  We have also identified some important topics for future studies. Among these are identification of adequate parameters and efficient algorithms for collision risk analysis at various well proximity ranges, and evaluation of the appropriateness of established model assumptions in light of the industry's current needs and practices.}

	abstract		= {The increased use of hole opening tools remote from the drill bit has led to a critical need to understand the interaction between the drill bit and the hole opening tool itself. Problems that can result from improper matching include vibration, inability to open hole, mechanical damage to string tools or to the bit, and sub-optimal drilling performance.  This paper explores the theoretical relationship between bit and reamer and modeling the relative aggressivity and stability of both tools, building on already established indices for predicting and comparing the performance of bits. It reviews the calculations and methodology of placement and development of both the bit and reamer for optimal interaction and performance. It also considers stabilization of the hole opening tool using both concentric and eccentric devices.  The paper also reveals the development of an interactive, intranet tool. This software incorporates logic regarding the configuration of the reamer and assesses these against key characteristics of the drill bit. The tool enables the user to accurately select the drill bit that best complements the reamer that will be utilized.  A number of examples from global applications are presented. These demonstrate reduced vibration, improved hole quality and hole opening performance, superior penetration rates, and overall significantly reduced drilling costs.}

For several years of research, high power lasers have been proven in the lab to create controllable perforation tunnels with enhanced flow properties. This paper presents the strategy of lab to field transformations to perforate horizontal well with two inches in diameter by twenty four inches deep at 10,000 feet in horizontal well.  High power laser is an alternative and innovative technology to currently used shaped charge perforation. Lasers are advanced in several industries for their several unique properties such as power, precision, control and reliability, with these properties; controllable non-damaged enhanced oriented perforated tunnels are achieved. Laser power can be adjusted precisely to control the depth of the tunnel; the tool can be oriented to create perforation in any direction regardless of the reservoir stress orientations as lasers are stress independent.  Shale, Sandstones (including tight sandstones) and carbonate rocks have been perforated at different conditions, the result from all rock types showed improvement in permeability and creation of controlled geometry without any compactions or damage. The success of the lab experiments lead to field deployment strategy to create the first in the industry laser perforation at 10,000 feet. Lab to field transformation is presented at different stages, first prove of concept, then design and test lab prototype tool, followed by improved field upscale downhole tool.  High power laser in downhole is a safe (non-explosive) perforation technology. The geometry, depth and orientation can be controlled very precisely to create clean enhanced perforated tunnel. With a single trip, several perforation shots can be made withoutthe need to load and unload the perforation tool. Laser source is mounted on the surface on a coiled tubing unit and the beam is transmitted via fiber optics cable totarget, the compact design of the tool make it suitable to fit in any slim hole.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this work is to present the development and evolutions of different high-power laser tools and their subsurface applications. These tools provide innovative and non-damaging alternatives to current downhole conventional technologies. In the lab, the laser technology has been proven to improve the flow properties and communication between the wellbore and formation. To achieve this efficiently in the field it is necessary to develop different tool designs and configurations, manufacture prototypes, conduct extensive tests, and optimize each part before upscale for field operations.  The laser source is mounted in a coil tubing rig at the surface; the coil contains the optical fiber cable used to convey the energy to the downhole tool. The tool combines mechanical and optical components to transform, control, and direct the laser beam. The design and configuration of each tool assembly varies depending on the targeted application. For example, the perforation tool converts and splits the beam into several horizontal beams; whereas the drilling tool emits a straight beam with controlled size for deeper penetration. They also incorporate purging capabilities to circulate gas or fluid to clean the hole from the debris and carry the cuttings. The entire assembly must be made to fit in slim holes as small as four inches. And finally, ruggedized to operate in a complex environment with high pressure and temperature.  The technology improves reach and provides versatility in a compact and environmentally friendly manner. For example, it is a waterless technology when it is used for fracturing, and a non-explosive based perforation when it is used to perforate. The unique features of the technology enable a precise, controlled, and oriented delivery of energy in any direction, regardless of the reservoir stress orientation and magnitude. Thus, it enhances reach to produce from pay zones that are bypassed by current conventional technologies and practice. The motivation to search for alternative technologies is the advancement of technologies including high power lasers, also the need to enhance several applications in deeper wells in an environmentally friendly manner.}

	abstract		= {Downhole drilling dynamics are poorly understood. Neither models nor experiments seem capable of fully describing the movements and forces of the drillstring during drilling. Downhole measurements could potentially hold the key to those missing insights, however data is not yet used to its full potential. This work addresses the barriers to obtaining value from downhole dynamics data and offers solutions to overcome them. A novel kinematic model was developed that fully accounts for sensor position and measurement design. It supports the hypothesis that lateral vibrations cause high-frequency fluctuations of tangential accelerations. Hence, against currently prevailing scientific opinion, \textquotedblleft{}high-frequency torsional oscillations\textquotedblright{} (HFTO) are not actually a torsional phenomenon, but the consequence of a lateral vibration. A downhole measurement tool under off-center rotation captures particular high-frequency data patterns that can be considered a sensor artifact. If ignored, these artifacts can impact the calculations of RPM and other derived measurements from downhole data. An extensive set of downhole data was analyzed to improve downhole dynamics data collection schemes for detecting drilling dysfunctions. For each prominent type of dysfunction, minimum data collection frequencies are specified. Such guidelines assist in collecting downhole data at sampling rates that are high enough to draw meaningful conclusions, but low enough to not flood limited available bandwidth and memory capacities. Even though a sensor is set up to measure only a single parameter along a single axis, it captures a variety of downhole events, which may lead to misinterpretations. These events can still be differentiated based on their typical frequency ranges. It is further shown how `noisy' frequency ranges can be detected and selectively removed by combining multiple downhole measurements. A lack of transparency and inefficient processes around sensor design, data collection, processing, and transfer cause misinterpretation and under-utilization of drilling downhole data. A review of tool design and sensor identifies sources of bad data quality. Eventually, defined data quality requirements will offer sustainable sensor data improvement. To work with downhole data generated under current circumstances, data processing techniques are developed and demonstrated. Algorithms that combine data, drilling processes, and physics automatically correct sensor errors. Further, a machine learning approach for automated vibration classification based on patterns is developed. A standardized structure to transfer downhole data from the service provider to the end user is suggested. The structure does not only define how the data should be shared, but also what additional data (metadata) is required. Specifications of such informational requirements improve transparency and comparability of measurements. Therefore, the proposed data format is a prerequisite for automated drilling data analysis}

	abstract		= {PDC bit modeling has historically incorporated the assumption that cutter forces are constant for a full revolution of the bit. This assumption places considerable limitations on the model's ability to simulate drilling in nonhomogeneous rock and in cases where the bit whirls. Recent studies have shown that cutter damage due to impact loading is a primary cause of PDC bit failure. These impacts may be caused by both bit whirl and drilling through nonhomogeneous rock. The three dimensional model presented in this paper provides the capability to evaluate cutter loading for both of these conditions. It shows that the cutter loads for common drilling situations may be as much as ten times greater than those calculated with previously available two dimensional models.  PDC bit development has been facilitated by models which predict cutter loading, volumes of rock removed, work rates, and cutter wear for a particular bit design. Modeling of the drag style bits was initiated in the 1960's in an effort to better understand the drilling stresses on the hard metal blades which were used as cutting structures. The high stresses were thought to be the cause of the metal fractures, as well as the rapid wear which occurred in the more abrasive formations. The impact stresses on the blades, resulting from dynamic movement of the bit axis away from the hole axis (due to bit wobble), were believed to be a primary cause of the fracturing along the gauge edges of the blades. Two dimensional calculations showed the stresses to be increased by a factor of five for a small misalignment of the bit/hole axes.},

	abstract		= {The ability to analyze drilling data to obtain continuous monitoring statistics of the drilling process and make prompt decisions are two important elements of a successful drilling operation. A mud motor is one of the important components of the downhole assembly, which enables the drill bit to penetrate the rock during drilling a well. Correctly predicting mud motor failure and the remaining useful life of the components are essential for obtaining drilling efficiency, avoiding costly operational expenses, and achieving timely maintenance. The remaining useful life indicator with low uncertainty identifies the life cycle of mud motors by preventing redundant maintenance and costly drilling operation failures.  This paper presents an industry-unique prognostics and health-management (PHM) solution for monitoring and maintaining the mud motor condition. This solution combines three algorithms, including a power section PHM algorithm, lower-end critical connections PHM algorithm, and mud motor degradation algorithm. The workflow solution allows for obtaining valuable information about the mud motor condition at the system and component levels.  The power section PHM algorithm, based on a remaining useful life prediction for the mud motor's power section, provides information about the elastomer condition inside of the stator as a percentage of the remaining life cycle. The lower-end critical connections PHM algorithm estimates the remaining useful life of the mud motor's lower-end connections. Both algorithms are component level; i. e., they help to improve managing the life cycle of the appropriate components. The mud motor degradation algorithm is a system-level algorithm. This algorithm uses drilling data to compute the severity of mud motor degradation; thus, identifying possible problems with the mud motor as a complete system.  The PHM solution helps to prevent expensive mud motor failure. Furthermore, the solution provides the opportunity to perform additional drilling runs before the motor components must be retired or removed for maintenance. The significant advantage of applying the PHM solution is it only makes use of existing drilling measurements and does not require any special downhole equipment.  The mud motor PHM solution is currently in use by one of the biggest oil \& gas service company worldwide. In addition to presenting the three algorithms, this paper presents field application case studies that demonstrate the commercial value and efficiency gains achieved by their use. Significant sustainability benefits have been achieved by using the power section and mud motor degradation algorithms due to their assistance in drilling applications.}

This situation requires new mindset in order to optimize tie-ins of new reserves to existing infrastructure. Retrofit multilateral well solutions are regarded as one enabeler in this context since they enable tie-in to existing producers from nearby targets through deep sidetrack operations.  There are many pre-requisites that must be in place for such solutions to be suitable. In addition, the risk of partial success involves loss of an existing producer.  A few such wells have been constructed by the operator in the last couple of years. The requirements and challenges are discussed. The implementations show that it is technically feasible to use conventional multilateral technology in ways that enable installation in producing wells. Improvements to existing solutions are sought in order to facilitate future implementations and to improve robustness of this technology.}

The designed simulator consists of a topside model capable of calculating block position, surface hookload, surface torque, and bottom hole pressure. To achieve drilling efficiency, a formation-based rate of penetration (ROP) optimization module is running in real-time, where the safe-operational windows are considered to reduce/avoid drilling accidents, like stick-slip, axial vibrations, poor hole cleaning, and low efficiency etc. The obtained optimal WOB and RPM by solving such ROP optimization are used as setpoints and then fed into the rotary steerable system module (RSS module) to steer the bit following a planned path. Such path is designed with multiple Bezier curves that can pass given target coordinates and maintain low dogleg severity (DLS). Furthermore, the high-tech AI methodologies are integrated to the simulator to smartly manage downhole pressure via perceiving and interpreting the data, learning through the trial, training through given policy, and taking optimal actions offered by the AI-agent.  The simulator is demonstrated to be a powerful and user-friendly tool for path design and optimization, real-time path control, and drilling performance optimization. It provides interactive and automatic operations of steering a bit passing multiple given target points and optimizing drilling behaviors to achieve high efficiency and low costs. From the results, the simulated (real-time) trajectory steered by the automatic RSS module integrating with surface drilling/control modules has small deviations from the planned trajectory. In the meanwhile, the simulator can precisely detect formation changes, accurately control the downhole pressure, and automatically optimize the drilling speed.  The progress of the whole simulation can be followed through the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) remotely, where the depth-base data view, time-base data view and 3D graphical wellbore trajectories are visualized. After drilling, data analytics is conducted so that useful information from operational drilling data can be extracted and subsequently evaluated for post well-analysis.}

The performance criteria included fluid stability, rheology, pressure transmission, and gas migration under downhole conditions. Test results demonstrating the methods developed are provided, along with the capabilities of the facility, custom fixtures, and equipment that were built to study the performance of these fluids.  A set of performance criteria and testing requirements were initially developed, which were then used to design and fabricate a novel pilot facility. The PSTF could generate downhole drilling conditions of 7,500 psig and temperatures above 300\textdegree{}F. Three custom-instrumented test articles were built to simulate wellbore geometry; one 10-ft long and one 18-ft long, both with a 2.62-in ID. The third article had a 10-ft long 6-in \texttimes{} 4-in annulus, with the eccentric internal pipe capable of 100-rpm rotation to mimic the drill string. The test articles could incline up to 45\textdegree{} to simulate deviated wells. Gas could be injected, and its migration rate measured in static and countercurrent flow using a video camera with full-bore sight glass, and gamma-ray densitometers. Dedicated sections for foam generation, measuring density, rheology, pressure transmission, and fluid sampling and imaging were provided.  Upon commissioning of the PSTF, a 1 1/2 year test program was successfully carried out using lightweight foams and hollow glass-bead fluids. Due to the novel nature of the tests, best practices and procedures were developed through experimentation to quantify static and dynamic fluid stability, gas migration, foam generation techniques, fluid imaging and characterization, pressure transmission, and rheology. A variety of measurement techniques and instrumentation were trialed in the test articles to determine the best methods for tracking gas migration. Experiments in the test articles yielded a large amount of performance data, including fluid stability over time at different temperature and pressure conditions, the impact of drill string rotation on fluid stability, migration velocities of gas bubbles (i.e., gas kicks) within the drilling fluids at stagnant and countercurrent flow conditions, and the impact of drill string rotation. Pressure transmission speeds were measured in the foam with varying gas fractions. Example datasets from the testing program are provided, along with detailed descriptions of the test methods.  The methods and test facility used to study lightweight drilling fluids are unique to the authors’ knowledge. For the first time, drilling fluids were analyzed in an annulus with a rotating pipe at downhole conditions at a pilot scale, and fluid stability along with gas migration were studied. These provide for rigorous testing of lightweight drilling fluids; the application of these fluids is expected to increase with declining reservoir pressures in oil and gas fields.}

	abstract		= {High frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a major contributing factor to the drilling dynamics-related bottomhole assembly (BHA) failures. These failures are costly because they not only damage the drilling tools but also cause significant nonproductive time (NPT) to the operational activity. It is therefore highly desirable to measure and mitigate this dysfunction in real time.  We have built a high-performance drilling dynamics module, which enables real-time or recorded mode measurements of this HFTO phenomenon. Using this measurement, we can deliver actionable insights to the rig or the rig crew in real time. With data from more than 3000 runs, we can build a clearer understanding of the real characteristics of HFTO, its drivers, and the effects it has on our drilling systems.  We show that with increasing Weight on Bit (WOB) the amplitude of the HFTO will increase. However, at high WOB the dysfunction amplitude will drop, while the ROP continues to rise. As such there is a sweet spot with high ROP and low HFTO.  By integrating this database of drilling dysfunctions with our records of tool damage and nonproductive time, we can map the effect of HFTO onto different failure criteria. As a result, we can define new and better operational standards and generate real-time insights into what damage is more likely to occur and how to change drilling parameters, if needed, to prevent it or determine if the vibration will pass without incident.  We also show that although the rotary steerable tools we use are sensitive to the effect of HFTO, our measurement while drilling (MWD) tools are not. For this latter group the probability of damage is the same for runs with and without HFTO.  This paper discusses the method and results for this study.}

The scope of this project is to combine academia and industry experience to analyze data from 13 different wells drilled in an area of 2 x 4 miles.

Once cleaned, the data can be fed into data analytics platforms and machine learning models to efficiently analyze trends and plan future well more efficiently. This roadmap will serve as a basis for drilling optimization. The objective of this work is to detail the various steps needed to prepare field drilling data for business analysis, as well discuss about data analytics and machine learning application in drilling operations. The results to be presented are the detailed workflow and description of the data preparation steps, an example analysis of the drilling data and an example application of a machine learning model in drilling.}

	abstract		= {Case studies have shown the benefits of applying a unique wellbore stabilization technology to solve lost circulation events occurring in varying pressurize, permeable, and fragile formations. Leveraging this technology can increase successful drilling in geologically complex areas while avoiding conventional solutions that are both costly and and, in some cases, do not solve the causes of non-productive time.  A unique wellbore stabilization technology has been proven effective in offshore wells in areas that are known to present small vugs, natural fissures, formation failure, wellbore erosion, and the associated drilling problems of lost circulation, poor cementing quality, problems running pipe, etc. When compared with the cost and operational lack of success offered by conventional ``solutions'' versus the relative low-cost and operational successes of the unique wellbore stabilization technology, the choice is clear \textendash{} where use is appropriate, the stabilization technology has provided a greater success rate and trouble-free drilling operations at a lower cost than traditional solutions.  The unique wellbore stabilization product is designed to address microfractures (as small as 3 $\mu$m) up to much larger fractures (3,000 $\mu$m). The product can be added to oil-based or water-based fluids at functional levels without adversely impacting the fluid rheology. Once in the drilling fluid, the stabilization product forms a pressure-sensitive layer on the formation wall to isolate the drilling fluid from the wellbore and stop fluid invasion that leads to formation failure, uncontrollable lost circulation, and well control issues. Once drilling is completed, the drop in pressure differential of the wellbore fluid allows the protective particles in the drilling fluid to lift off with the initiation of production. In the Campeche wells, one early study showed a 36\% reduction in drilling time and 24\% reduction in cost.  This paper discusses the various options explored and detail the technical analysis that preceded the application of the wellbore stability technology. Case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the fluid technology in drilling three wells which encountered variable pressure regimes, from the highly pressurized Paleocene at around 5,000 m to underlying low-pressure sandstones. These three wells and their offsets represent the successful application of this low-invasion technology in major drilling basins where lost circulation events would normally incur major operational expenses and non-productive time (NPT).}

	abstract		= {Rotary steerable systems (RSS) were first introduced as push-the-bit systems in the late 1990s and were drilling in manual mode sending downlinks by mud pulses downhole. The point-the-bit RSS was introduced in 2003. The first automated mode, known as inclination hold, was introduced in 2003. This was followed by vertical mode in 2004 and by hold inclination and azimuth mode in 2008. The last well profile type, the curve section, was not automated until 2020 when curve control was implemented for push-the-bit RSS. Implementing curve control for push-the-bit RSS has reduced the frequency of downlinks sent from surface and has improved the rate of penetration, thereby supporting a sustainable digital solution for directional drilling and drilling engineering. Curve control for point-the-bit RSS was introduced to the field in mid-2022 and has opened new applications for downhole automation. Point-the-bit RSS has a different steering mechanism (fixed bend) and it has the sensor offset farther from the bit, which creates challenges for implementation of trajectory automation.  In our work, we analysed several case studies and examined new application opportunities for autonomy for trajectory automation based on the field results. Until mid-2022 directional drillers sent manual downlinks to point-the-bit RSS from the surface to follow a planned trajectory and hit the target. These downlinks sent a steering ratio to achieve desired dogleg severity (DLS) and a desired toolface to turn the well if needed. By introducing downhole automation, the Directional Driller is able to send curvature commands, and the tool determines steering ratio to achieve planned DLS by applying a closed-loop algorithm to drill the trajectory. The closed-loop system minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on trajectory response.  Point-the-bit RSS have shown the ability to drill different curve profiles in curve control mode from 2D build to 3D build or drop. Some of the trajectories included a tangent section that were executed with DLS demand of zero. The case studies demonstrate that curve control mode has drilled entire hole sections while reducing the frequency of downlinks, increasing the rate of penetration, and increasing consistency.  Our work examined the next level of downhole automated directional trajectory control for point-the-bit RSS that is currently handled and controlled by the directional drillers (e.g., geometric and geological steering). The curve control mode minimizes the interactions with the surface and allows the driller/surface system to optimize the drilling parameters. The algorithm also minimizes the influences of variations of weight on bit, RPM, and formation characteristics on the trajectory response.}

	abstract		= {Traditional casing point selection fails to reflect influx dynamics and leverage managed pressure drilling (MPD) advancements in the well design process, which often leads to over-engineering and increased expenditure. This study proposes a new approach that integrates MPD into the casing design process, employing a reduced drift-flux model (RDFM) to account for complexity. The methodology aims to optimize casing design and enable real-time assessment of kick tolerance (KT) while drilling, exploiting opportunities for optimization.  In this study, we present a comprehensive approach for determining kick tolerance thresholds, considering current operating conditions and equipment limitations. Improving on industry-accepted rules of thumb for kick volume (25 bbl) and kick intensity (0.5 ppg), this work delivers a fit-for-purpose kick tolerance criterion. The research indicates that casing point selection can be significantly influenced by previously overlooked factors, such as the impact of temperature on formation stress, kick dilution in drilling fluid and annular distribution, as well as pressure and temperature effects and rig kick detection capabilities. Including these in the design criteria yields more accurate and efficient well construction planning and reduced well control risks. Practical case history results demonstrate the potential to extend critical sections by up to 60\% while increasing the manageable kick volume, consequently eliminating at least 2 casing strings out of a 7 string well design.  The proposed methodology is shown to be suitable for real-time implementation, allowing drillers to make more informed decisions about casing point selection and section length extension while still ensuring safe well operations. This enhances the flexibility of the drilling process and leads to the reduction and simplification of over-engineered well schematics and excess number of casing strings, resulting in significant well construction cost savings.  This work presents a novel approach for MPD well design and casing point selection, considering overlooked factors such as case-specific defined thresholds for kick volume and intensity, complex gas behavior, and temperature-dependent formation stresses for pressure evaluation. Furthermore, it extends the scope to the drilling process by introducing the real-time assessment of KT, generating additional opportunities for optimization, and improving well control safety. In addition, it proves the suitability of an RDFM model for KT assessment.}

	abstract		= {The extraction of mechanical friction, during drilling operations, is an important source of information to estimate whether the downhole conditions are sub-optimal, for instance because of poor cuttings transport or additional tortuosity induced by the directional work. Traditionally, the friction factors are extracted using steady state torque and drag models. But, there are contexts, like when drilling from a floater, where it is difficult to find any periods where stable conditions can be observed.  A possible solution to this problem consists in running, in real-time, a transient torque and drag model connected to a high refresh-rate feed of measurements taken by the drilling machines sensors, and to utilize continuous calibration methods to extract information about the unknown or ill-defined parameters that influence the drill-string mechanical system. For those parameters that should stay constant throughout a bottom hole assembly (BHA) run, the estimation method shall account for the totality of the observations and therefore utilizes calibration methods based on statistical global optimization principles, while time-dependent parameters are estimated using a filtering technique.  This approach is only valid when utilizing a trustworthy transient drill-string mechanical model. Comparisons between estimated values from transient torque and drag models and actual measurements have highlighted the importance of robust modelling at the boundaries of the mechanical system. For instance, when modelling precisely the top-drive and the hoisting system mechanical behavior with its associated heave compensation system, it is then possible to obtain a good match between estimated and observed top-drive torques and top-of-string forces, while the bit is off bottom. Furthermore, it requires a precise modelling of the bit/formation interaction to get a truthful dynamic response of the model when the bit is on bottom and only passive heave compensation is used. Associated with its continuously updated calibration of the ill-defined parameters of the system, such a transient torque and drag model enables the visualization, in real-time, of the internal displacements of the drill-string even in the most complex drilling conditions.  Until recently, drill-string dynamic modelling has mostly focused on the lower part of the drill-string, i.e. just above the BHA, and has been reserved to post-analysis evaluations, as existing solutions have been very computer intensive. This paper describes a solution that runs in real-time and that considers the whole drill-string, allowing for the extension of drilling automation functions to very dynamic conditions like those encountered on a floater.}

	abstract		= {The use of downhole rotational speed measurements made at 300Hz gives new insight into the conditions under which stick-slip torsional oscillations occur. Observations made with high-frequency magnetometers while drilling two reservoir sections have shown, that for these wellbores, using top-drive speeds below 140rpm leads to severe downhole torsional oscillations, also in off-bottom conditions. Additionally, it was observed that downlinking the rotary steerable system (RSS) initiated heavy stick-slip and that reaming downward had a negative damping effect on downhole torsional stability.  These observations have been compared and partly matched with estimations made with a transient hydro-mechanical model. Some ill-defined information had to be estimated, like the amount of flow diversion during the downlinking procedure, the coefficients of static and kinetic friction along the borehole, or the bit efficiency and aggressivity.  Downhole measurements have shown that when the drill-string is subject to strong stick-slip conditions, the downhole rotational speed changes from stationary to more than 400rpm in just a fraction of a second. It is therefore important to utilize sampling rates that are compatible with such very fast events. In practice, that means several hundred Hertz.  A challenge associated with analysis of downhole high frequency data is time synchronization and drift of clocks between the surface and downhole measurements. After time synchronization and correction, it appears that the downhole rotational movement is delayed by several tens of seconds compared to the actual top-drive speed. This leads to question whether rotating the drill-string off-bottom, typically done in order to break gelled-up mud prior to establishing circulation, has any significant the intended effects deviated wells as torque along the drill-string must be built up.  Direct observations of downhole rotational speed at high frequency help in discovering conditions that were not suspected to lead to large torsional oscillations. This new information can be used to improve drilling operational procedures and models of the drilling process, therefore enabling increased drilling efficiency.}

	abstract		= {Drilling process automation solutions provide positive assistance to the driller, and increase consistency in execution of drilling procedures. However, in drilling automation the use of automated drilling advisors can reduce human operator situational awareness. Therefore, systems that automatically detect and react to drilling incidents must support the driller. These critical systems cover Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) functions. This paper presents a method that facilitates the interoperability of drilling automation advisors for FDIR functions. Some drilling events happen so fast that mitigation (FDIR) must be implemented directly at the automated drilling control system (ADCS) level. Yet, FDIR functions often need dynamic parametrization from external sources since the ADCS may lack access to mandatory information needed for correct detection and mitigation of the incident. This requires interoperability, communications without human intervention, between the ADCS and the external sources of the parameters for the FDIR function. To interconnect the two sides of the problem, the ADCS describes its capabilities for fault detection and isolation and the external application, the automation Advisor, adapts to the exposed capabilities. On the one hand, the ADCS may implement various types of FDIR functions. On the other hand, external dynamic parameter functions may only address certain types of drilling incidents. Different ADCS providers implement such FDIR functionalities in different ways. Since this undermines the portability (interoperability) of the solutions provided by third party advisor applications, any drilling systems automation solution must address this communication issue. The simplest form of communication describes predefined capabilities, providing the ability to communicate based on an agreement about a set of statically defined possibilities. At an intermediate level of complexity, the ADCS describes its capabilities in a descriptive format that the external application interprets, and to which it can adapt. In the most advanced version, the ADCS describes that it allows the external parameter provider to configure the ADCS behavior to its needs. The paper describes a generic data model covering all three levels of the interface. Another implementation of the model is in the form of a micro-service that implements a REST API and exchanges Json formatted data objects. The latter is therefore agnostic to programming languages and computer platforms. This work is part of the D-WIS (Drilling and Wells Interoperability Standard) initiative advancing industry wells digital systems interoperability. D-WIS is a cross-industry workgroup providing the industry with solutions to facilitate interoperability of digital and computer systems at the rig site. The proposed solution delivers retrofitting ease for existing solutions but is sufficiently flexible to accommodate to new and not yet known FDIR functions. It is a key function for systems interoperability at the rig site, directly addressing situational awareness for the driller.}

	abstract		= {Tripping operations are the source of possible serious drilling incidents caused by swab and surge pressures exceeding the geo-pressure margins. Yet, it is difficult to monitor the actual downhole pressure during tripping because of telemetry limitations but also because there are no available methods to measure downhole pressure below the bit. Hydraulic models are therefore necessary to estimate the downhole pressure along the whole open hole section, also below the bit. It is therefore important to understand the factors influencing downhole pressure estimations when the drill-string is only subject to axial displacement.  In most cases tripping procedures consist in a series of drill-string movements intertwined with connection procedures. While tripping, the drill-string needs to accelerate from a stand-still position and to stop at another position. As a result of these accelerations and decelerations, hydraulic calculations must be transient. Furthermore, the movement of the bottom of the string is not synchronous with the top of string displacement because of the elasticity of the string, meaning that transient torque and drag estimations are also necessary. Actually, when using a floater, the top of string movement is influenced by heave also during connection. When the drill-string is displaced, drilling fluid needs to be added or is returned to the trip tank, depending on the direction. Consequently, the drilling fluid columns in the string and in the annulus change position affecting the downhole temperature conditions. As the fluid density and viscous behavior depends much on the local condition of pressure and temperature, heat transfer estimations also play a role on downhole pressure estimations. The evaluation of downhole pressure requires the combined estimations of transient hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer models.  The drilling fluid is also subject to gelling in a non-uniform manner along the borehole. Drilling fluid with high viscosity at low shear rate may take several minutes to return to hydrostatic conditions like for example during connection. Depending on the static and kinetic friction factors, part of the drill-string may remain stretched also after the top of string movement has stopped. Consequently, connection time influences the swab and surge variations for the next stand. Therefore, a tripping operation is typically a non-holonomic process which requires a continuous follow-up of the time evolution of the hydraulic, mechanical and heat transfer variables to be able to predict accurately the downhole pressure.  Through several examples from actual tripping operations, the importance of the mutual interaction between transient hydraulic, mechanic and heat transfer, as well as the non-holonomy of tripping operations is shown. Understanding the factors that influence swab and surge estimations is of paramount importance to progress with the automation of tripping operations.}

	abstract		= {Well construction requires the cooperation of subject matter experts with differing backgrounds. Each discipline has its own viewpoint on the topics addressed by the collaboration team, which complicates multi-disciplinary work. Software tools often embed these differences, rendering the exchange of data subject to the assumptions of the differing backgrounds and disciplines. This can pose significant risk to well, human, asset value and environmental safety. Well construction software applications need to be versatile enough to describe and interpret the meaning of exchanged data while allowing for the inherent assumptions.  Facts about data best describe the meaning of the exchanged data. A semantic network can describe the relationships between concepts or meanings, which it does by collecting and relating facts about the data. The existing data repositories used in well construction use predefined and agreed upon meanings for the contained data. A semantic network, however, allows software applications to interpret the meaning of the transferred data, even when the original meaning and inherent assumptions are different from that of the receiving application. Obviously, the manual generation of such semantic information by end-users is not practical. Each software application needs to generate and interpret semantic information alongside the published data.  A simple example illustrates the potentially costly consequences of the differing meanings of exchanged information in a multi-disciplinary well construction environment. Three different end-users\textemdash{}a geomechanics engineer, a drilling engineer, and a measurement-while-drilling (MWD) engineer\textemdash{}exchange information, using computer applications, about downhole pressure measurements acquired during a drilling operation. The downhole pressures are in equivalent mud weight (EMW) units. Due to the different disciplines involved, each application utilizes a different definition when converting downhole pressure to EMW. The assumptions related to the accuracy of not only the mud density but also the vertical depth, then create expectations that may not be in line with reality, and each of the three different users themselves have different uncertainty expectations.  These different definitions require information on context to avoid misinterpretation. If the three applications can document the meaning of the exchanged data and can interpret the meaning of the received semantical information, then they can mitigate the risk of incorrect interpretation of the EMW data and provide quantification of the associated uncertainties. The scenario described also covers a change in context from conventional drilling to a well control incident. A different interpretation of the meaning of the data must follow the change in context. The paper explains how the three applications can describe the meaning of the exchanged data in order to correctly interpret information and manage the associated uncertainties both in terms of expectations as well as results.  Digitalization of the drilling industry is progressing rapidly, accompanied by the ability to exchange information between computer systems. This clearly breaks down the walls between the different disciplines involved in well planning and drilling operations. It is also important to recognize the uncertainty expectations between disciplines. These expectations must be managed so that the assumptions made are harmonious. To maximize potential opportunities, it is important to maintain the quality of information exchanged between computer systems to mitigate the introduction of significant risk to well, human and environmental safety.}

	abstract		= {Accurate measurement of the flow rate out of a well during drilling is essential for optimizing drilling performance and ensuring operational efficiency and safety. In conventional drilling, a flowmeter placed in the return flowline shall not introduce pressure drops and shall work without being filled. A new concept using a rotating measuring wheel fulfills these two requirements. However, it needs to be verified that the concept is sufficiently precise over the wide range of flowrates that can be experienced during a drilling operation as well as being accurate for non-Newtonian fluids containing cuttings and gas.  The measurement principle of the rotating wheel mass flowmeter involves directing the fluid, including cuttings and gas, through the center of a horizontal rotating wheel and collecting it via a funnel. The measuring wheel has vertical vanes onto which the drilling fluid applies a force due to the Coriolis acceleration. The forces on the vanes result in a torque that can be measured on the axle of the driving motor. This torque is directly proportional to the mass flowrate of fluid passing through the measuring wheel. To verify the accuracy of the sensor, a medium scale apparatus has been built and used in a flow-loop together with a high precision vibrating tube Coriolis flowmeter for reference. The test procedures consist of measuring flowrates with a range scale of 5 to 120 kilograms per minute with various drilling fluids.  The medium scale apparatus successfully handled flow rates up to the expected operational limit with optimal rotational speeds identified for different flow rates. The experiments encompassed various fluids, including water, glycerin (representing high-viscosity Newtonian fluid), and non-Newtonian drilling fluid samples. During the tests, issues related to design, instrumentation, and control system were identified and addressed. The results of the tests confirm that the rotating wheel mass flowmeter establishes a linear relationship between torque and mass flow rate, and that this linear relationship is valid both at low and high rotational speeds.  The benefits of this new mass flowmeter include acceptable accuracy and reduced maintenance requirements, and is also functional at very small rates, compared to traditional methods like the flow paddle. This research represents a significant step towards the development of a full-scale device, supporting an agile development process in the field of digitalization and automation of drilling operations.}

Research and development using data from multiple sources have led to the development of an intelligent hole-cleaning answer product that can be used for a wellbore risk reduction service. The service would aim to optimize the rate of penetration through better understanding of hole cleaning. This digital solution that will enhance the well construction process by optimizing hole cleaning in real time. This solution is best delivered by using a combination of data and processes from multiple sources such as along-sting measurements (ASM), surface data, and downhole tools. There are several applications for this service such as land drilling, deepwater wells, horizontal wells, multilateral wells, highly deviated wells, and extended reach drilling.  The service uses a combination of technologies previously only available as separate services. The service uses ASM sensors to optimize hole cleaning. Calibration of the cutting pressure profile with a real-time simulator using a multipoint pressure measurement along the string is provided. In addition to ASM sensors, the weight and volume of the cuttings are continuously recorded at the flow lines and compared to theoretical data. As a result, mud rheology, wiper trips, and drilling parameters can be optimized, and hole-cleaning best practices can be refined. Stuck pipe, cuttings bed buildups, and wellbore instability can be detected and mitigated against, enabling safer drilling and minimization of nonproductive time. This paper will showcase how this can be done and what visualizations can be shown. It is intended to give a peak at the solution developed.}

	abstract		= {In difficult drilling environments, a critical aspect for success is BHA design optimization in the pre-job phase. In previous operations, modeling and run simulations have proven valuable at helping operators improve drilling efficiency (reduce NPT; increase footage/day), produce high-quality log data and properly position the wellbore to increase contact with the reservoir. To further improve modeling accuracy/reliability, a dynamic modeling system was used for BHA analysis. The FEA (finite element analysis)-based system enables engineers to leverage the team's combined expertise and full suite of drilling tools to optimize a BHA for a specific application.  Four criteria are used to evaluate BHA performance during simulations: stability; robustness/reliability; measurement quality; steerability. Simulations are run to determine each configuration's potential for axial, lateral/torsional vibration and identify the root cause and dominant mode. To ensure maximum BHA robustness, the loading on BHA components is mapped/rated allowing refinements to increase BHA service life and reduce the potential for costly NPT. Simulations are run to observe the potential for MWD/LWD tool deformation and sag angle to determine the adverse effect sensor motion could have on measurement quality. To mitigate steerability issues, build/walk tendencies are simulated to determine how the BHA will respond to steering command from RSS/PDM.  A wide-range of factors can be considered in this procedure. Various cutting structures and steering tools are analyzed and modified as required. The type and location of BHA components are also modeled and re-positioned for optimization purposes. Various drilling scenarios and operating parameters are fed into the system including RPM/WOB, sliding/rotating time, back-reaming and rotating off bottom. Formation characteristics including rock types, friction factor, heterogeneity/homogeneity, degree/amount of interbedding can all be varied to investigate the BHA's corresponding directional implications and vibrational response.  All potential BHA designs are evaluated under a set of pre-defined drilling scenarios. A comparative analysis is performed to investigate BHA responses against each specific criterion to identify the optimum BHA configuration. Operating conditions are analyzed for each BHA and an optimal parameter window of minimized BHA shock and vibration is generated with a range of RPM/WOB recommendations. The authors will present several conclusive case studies that document the method's effectiveness and cost reducing capabilities.}

	abstract		= {Deepwater wells routinely use concentric reaming devices in the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to lower the equivalent circulating density (ECD). In Gulf of Mexico (GOM) applications, concentric reamers are frequently used and are positioned approximately 100 to 150 feet behind the pilot bit to address formation evaluation and other operational constraints. This distance between a drill bit and the concentric reamer poses bit\textendash{}reamer synchronization challenges, especially while drilling interbedded formations, where the bit could drill a softer formation while the reamer is placed in a harder formation or vice versa. This situation causes fluctuations in the compressive load at the bit and reamer. Cutting element damage often results from overloading, leading to a premature and costly trip. In many cases, the pilot bit or reamer could be deprived of the optimal compressive load to cut the formation, resulting in lower-than-expected penetration rates. Inadequate and fluctuating compressive loads at the bit or reamer often trigger unsustainable vibrations.  Efforts to address the bit-reamer matching issue are ongoing in the industry, and managing the aggressiveness of pilot bit and reamer is frequently used as a potential solution. Although modelling programs are extensively used during the well planning process, a lack of specific guidelines continues to exist in the industry.  Hybrid bits, which combine polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) and tungsten carbide insert (TCI) rolling cutter elements, have been widely and successfully used in GOM. These bits offer higher drilling efficiency because of their dual cutting elements and balanced aggressiveness. The results of 18?-in. hybrid drill bit usage with a concentric reamer provided encouraging results and offered a potential solution to the bit-reamer synchronization issue.  Using real-time downhole data, this paper evaluates and compares bit and reamer load distribution, drilling mechanics of PDC and hybrid bits, and provides valuable analytical insights on successful application of hybrid bits to address the issue of bit-reamer synchronization.}

	abstract		= {The current IADC bit dull grading process has served the drilling industry well for over 30 years, and it has helped the industry achieve significant improvements in drill bit selection and design. With rapid development of computational techniques such as computer vision and machine learning, the general consensus is that the previous grading process can now be updated to capture additional information about the bits that was previously discarded to enhance the grading process and the information is delivers while keeping it simple. An IADC committee is currently working on finalizing this new schema.  In comparison to the previous bit dull grading process, more details about the drill bit such as cutter damage type have been added to the new schema. Additionally, capturing pre-run and post-run bit images is recommended to enable detailed bit forensic analysis into root causes of observed damage. For the bit dull grading process at rig site, a preliminary grading report needs to be filled out and rig site bit photos also need to be captured.  The objective of the work reported here was to develop an algorithm to automatically analyze 2D bit images and quickly generate are port that fulfills the new IADC dull grading requirements. Several deep learning models and classic machine learning algorithms were developed to automate the bit dull grading process. Given a set of high-quality bit images, the proposed set of algorithms will process and analyze the images automatically and generate a dull grading report. Different sets of bit images were tested with the proposed algorithms, and the results show that they are able to achieve good performance under standard scenarios. A discussion on hurdles that remain to be tackled is also included.}

	abstract		= {Still images captured using mobile phone cameras have been shown to be very useful for bit forensics purposes. However, since still images can only capture views at certain viewing angles, they often provide insufficient information on each cutter's diamond table and substrate. Videos solve the problem of lack of view angles. This paper demonstrates how a video captured on a phone can provide additional bit information benefiting forensics, and provides recommendations for capturing videos to maximize information content.  Bit forensics as well as the future IADC dull grading system require meticulous data collection for various drill bit regions, including critical information such as blade numbers and cutter locations. To automate this process, this paper introduces a multi-stage approach using bit videos. Initially, a detection model is employed to accurately locate the drill bit within the video. Next, computer vision algorithms are utilized to segment the different blades. Spatial geometry algorithms are then applied to reconstruct the camera trajectory, which aids in estimating the blade numbers. Finally, each cutter within the segmented blades is further segmented into different regions.  This study explores the utilization of videos for the automated location segmentation of drill bits, a crucial aspect of the revised IADC dull grading system currently being proposed. The videos capture the entire drill bit from multiple angles, encompassing top-down views and a full 360-degree rotation. The IADC dull grading system necessitates the precise recording of position information including blade numbers, pocket numbers, and bit zones. By employing videos instead of still images, this study demonstrates that spatial geometric information of the drill bit can be obtained more completely and efficiently. Given a video that conforms to established shooting standards, the proposed automatic position calculation algorithm efficiently completes the segmentation of different parts of the drill bit and labels them in accordance with the relevant standards. Notably, video capturing offers several advantages over still photography; it obviates the need for complex training for operators, only necessitating adherence to basic camera trajectory guidelines, and substantially reduces the time needed to collect such data. Importantly, the location segmentation algorithm employed in this study is capable of running in real-time, thereby streamlining and accelerating the IADC dull grading and bit forensics processes.  This paper introduces a novel video-based algorithm for drill bit segmentation. The algorithm automatically segments and labels various components of the drill bit as per established criteria, generating comprehensive data vital for damage analysis. By employing this algorithm, videos of PDC drill bits can be processed with remarkable speed and accuracy. This represents a substantial advancement in data collection methods, with implications for improving the quality of bit damage assessment.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents the successful development and implementation of a wellbore quality scorecard which is used to evaluate wellbore quality using deterministic and probabilistic methods. This evaluation is based on analysing the real time data during the final trip out of hole with the drilling BHA.  The Wellbore Quality Scorecard is being used systematically across a large multi-asset drilling project where there was a history of problematic hole sections. Casing and liner running operations frequently encountered difficulties, and it was recognised that a system for evaluating the hole condition would help to improve operational decision making. The result of the evaluation is used to provide a better understanding of the condition of the wellbore that was drilled before committing to run casing or liner. Understanding the wellbore condition helps the team to decide, for example, whether to run a wiper trip to condition the wellbore or to save time and go ahead with casing or liner run.  The evaluation process is a collaboration between the remote collaboration centre, the rigsite team and the office-based operations team. A database is generated which records historical wellbore condition vs liner and casing running information which holds very useful technical insights about how each wellbore parameter quantitatively affects the wellbore quality.  The paper will describe how this process has now been applied to over 50 hole sections, and how it has improved decision making and the liner and casing running success rate.  A machine learning model has been developed which predicts the likelihood of successfully running the casing or liner to the target depth. This information is used to compliment the Wellbore Quality Score for informing operational decisions.}

	abstract		= {The use of Managed Pressure Drilling has widespread applications in the Permian Basin. In this basin, typically MPD is used in a more traditional and somewhat limited fashion. However, using MPD as a performance drilling technique is a relatively unexplored application and early results have yielded significant rate of penetration (ROP) increases and days shaved off wells.  While MPD has been used in this area for more traditional methods such as Early Kick Loss Detection and controlling inflows of over-pressured disposal zones, using MPD for performance drilling is a novel application in the area. Performance drilling is the act of reducing the typical, conventional mud weights, and supplementing the decrease in hydrostatic pressure with applied surface back pressure. This reduction in mud weight allows for cost savings in multiple areas, increases in ROP and an overall reduction in well construction costs.  CrownQuest wanted to implement MPD, for performance drilling, on deeper basin Wolfcamp wells (Wolfcamp D), where higher mud weights (12.5-13 ppg) were commonly being run. The well was planned for a 2.5 pounds per gallon (ppg) reduction in mud weight, compared to conventional. These wells drilled with reduced mud weights were compared with previously drilled Wolfcamp D wells in the same area. The results showed a 23.8\% increase in average ROP throughout the production hole section and an average of 5.85 days saved, with the implementation of MPD for performance drilling. Enabling a lighter mud system also seen a reduction in average lateral mud costs of 25\% related to building and maintaining the mud, as seepage losses were reduced and fewer weighting and supplementary materials were required for maintaining the active system. Lower mud weights reduce the ECD at the bit and reduce solids in the mud, which allowed for further changes and improvements to the drilling program. After MPD was implemented, these changes enabled the operator to complete a pace-setter, one-run build and lateral section with a intermediate drill out time to rig release (RR) of 5.3 days. Using MPD for performance drilling can save days per well, reduce costs, and improve overall ESG and well economics.  Wolfcamp wells that require heavier mud weights, and are considered more difficult to drill, than upper Wolfcamp formations can become more economical by implementing these performance drilling methods. These techniques to drill deeper Wolfcamp targets more economically could prove invaluable as prime acreage and shallower Wolfcamp targets are drilled and depleted.}

	abstract		= {Displacement to a dedicated screen running fluid (e.g. low-solids mud) is a common method to lower the solids loading of the fluid prior running the completion screens in order to minimize the risk of blockages. However, some advanced drill-in fluids exhibit excellent long-term stabilities under downhole conditions which allow for a dual use also as screen running fluid. A systematic selection of such a fluid for a horizontal well in an oilfield offshore Norway is presented.  Samples of different 1.2 SG oil-based drilling fluids and screen running fluid candidates were statically aged at 200 bar and 87 \textdegree{}C for 1 and 2 months. Complementarily characterization was performed by running viscometer sag shoe tests and laser particle size analysis of the samples. Actual core plugs of the reservoir section were selected for core flooding/formation damage tests covering different drill-in fluids and sequences including screen insertion with and without prior displacement to an actual screen running fluid. The return permeability and a detailed required draw-down analysis was performed.  Experiments have shown that the downhole stability is commonly underestimated when the surrounding pressure is lower than in the field like in a conventional aging cell. One of the drill-in fluids showed superior long-term stability with maintaining mobility even after 2 months of aging and no phase separation of significant settling. In contrast, the low-solids oil-based mud showed significant phase separation and some settling. Laboratory results were implemented to the flied by strict specification of the mud properties and verification by a comprehensive post-operational QA/QC of field samples in the laboratory.  The success was proven by no negative impact on productivity of the well compared to previously drilled and completed wells in the field. However, running the completion in DIF resulted in significant de-risking of drilling operations, cost savings and eliminated logistical challenges from previous wells.}

Following an early suggestion (Fairhurst and Lacabanne, Min. Quarry Engng, 157-161, 194-197, 1957) that the bit-rock interaction is characterized by the coexistence of rock cutting and frictional contact, the torque and weight-on-bit are each decomposed into two components associated with these basic processes. By postulating that the cutting component of T and W is proportional to the depth of cut per revolution, ? = 2?v/?, and that a linear constraint exists between the frictional component of T and W, a linear relation is derived between the specific energy E and the drilling strength L two quantities with dimensions of stress, that are respectively proportional to T and W, and inversely proportional to ?. The original assumptions appear to be justified when the model is tested against published experimental results, as the data point cluster along a line in the E-L diagram. Interpretation of experimental data suggests that the contact friction coefficient actually reflects the internal frictional property of the rock. It is also proposed that the influence of the bit design on the drilling response is embodied in a single number ?, which depends on the shape of the cutting edge and on the distribution of cutters on the bit body.}

The directional wells and other special trajectory drilling technologies are often used in deep water, deep well, hard rock, and brittle shale formations.  In drilling these complex wells, the cost caused by V\&S increases. According to past theories, indoor experiments, and field studies, the relations among ten kinds of V\&S, which contain basic forms, response frequency, and amplitude, are summarized and discussed. Two evaluation methods are compared systematically, such as theoretical and measurement methods. Typical vibration measurement tools are investigated and discussed. The control technologies for drill string V\&S are divided into passive control, active control, and semiactive control. Key methods for and critical equipment of three control types are compared. Based on the past development, a controlling program of drill string V\&S is devised. Application technologies of the drill string V\&S are discussed, such as improving the rate of penetration, controlling borehole trajectory, finding source of seismic while drilling, and reducing the friction of drill string. Related discussions and recommendations for evaluating, controlling, and applying the drill string V\&S are made.},

In alignment with a major operator's protocol in the Midland Basin, our approach focuses on mitigating bit damage and standardizing connection methods. A pivotal feature of this automation was its adaptability to different sequences and parameters without altering the software. After comprehensive testing on a drilling simulator, a field trial was initiated in the Midland Basin. Following positive feedback on the system's consistency and reliability, its use was expanded to three more rigs. The results revealed enhanced operator and rig contractor performance, especially in uniform connection performance and improved S2W and W2S durations. A collaborative relationship between product teams, operations, and the operator was essential in maximizing these benefits. Crucially, the collaboration between the operator and rig contractor was key to developing a quickly adopted, value-driven product.}

	abstract		= {This paper recommends standardized names and equations for the two most common uses of Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) concepts: ``Total MSE'' and "Downhole MSE". These names and their equations should be used uniformly in all applications, including electronic drilling recorder (EDR) pick lists, rig site surveillance, engineering surveillance, data analytics, research, and technical publications.  Mechanical Specific Energy, used as a metric for drilling efficiency, is a mathematical calculation of the energy used per volume of rock drilled. The Downhole MSE equation calculates the efficiency of the bit alone, while the Total MSE equation includes both the bit and drill string. Those who use MSE in surveillance or analytics know the negative effects created by the lack of standardization over the years; it is certainly not a new problem.  The lack of standardized nomenclature has resulted in the use of the same name for different equations, or different names are given two equations that are identical. This affects the ability of drill teams to engage vendors in redesign of performance limitations or to communicate new operational practices between teams or rigs. In addition, this standard corrects a mathematical error that is common in calculating the Total MSE.  The concern with the inconsistencies has increased as MSE has become a key element in many automated optimization schemes. Inconsistencies or uncertainties in the basis of MSE values calculated in real time or shared in large data sets will affect the industry's ability to develop useful analytics or to automate rig control platforms and data-driven decisions.  This paper also includes a discussion of the MSE measurement errors and their effect on calculated values, which is of particular interest to controls engineers and those involved in data analytics. Examples are provided to illustrate how the two different MSE values are used in field operations. Also, a substantial reference list of current and potential future uses of MSE is included to encourage better MSE-based practices to potentially lead to the development of new uses in the future, including automation.  This ad hoc MSE Standardization Committee is a volunteer group with representation from operators, rig contractors, service companies, and data acquisition vendors.  The guidance given reflects there shared experience in utilizing MSE in surveillance and analytics, and the recommended equations are technically correct.},

The advances were possible because the operating team was trained to understand how bit dysfunction and other non-bit limiters physically work, and had the knowledge required to mitigate these limiters in real-time or redesign to extend them when possible. In the final runs of the most recent well in the field, the ROP when rotating bent motors ranged from 150 ft/hr. to more than 300 ft/hr. and overall cumulative on-bottom rotating hours were reduced despite a more challenging, high angle well path with steering constraints.  The paper covers the workflows and practices used to:Extend the safe WOB and RPM limits of bits beyond the industry's common practices in granite (65-70K lbs. and 250 RPM on 9.5" bits)Continue to expand the industry's understanding of the application of clear water drilling fluids to mitigate low drill rates caused by dilatant strengthening (bottom hole balling)Drill with RSS in granite to achieve a smooth curve to 65° inclination.  Demonstrate practices for drilling a high angle tangent with a bent motor to achieve higher drill rates while still delivering borehole quality equaling or exceeding that of an RSS.  Evaluate practices to reduce the large decline in ROP observed in early footage with all bits in hard formations. This represents the largest opportunity for additional performance gains in geothermal drilling.  The paper incorporates both the specific practices implemented and the processes required to take a new operations team from initial project startup to record setting performance within the span of a single well (each FORGE well has been drilled by a different team). The authors’ intent in this and the previous paper, SPE 208798 (Dupriest and Noynaert, 2022), is to enable others to duplicate the gains at FORGE.}

	abstract		= {The drillstring used in the oil and gas exploration is a complex structure due to the different forces acting on it. One of the
primary sources of drillstring vibrations is the cutting forces caused by the drill bit contact with the rock formation. In some drilling applications, such as hole enlargement and underreaming, the source of the cutting action originates from the drill bit as well as the reamer which increases the dynamic complexity of the drillstring. This paper’s objective is to investigate the torsional vibration behaviors of the bottom hole assembly (BHA) under simultaneous drilling and reaming. More specifically, it addresses the effect of the reamer interaction with the wellbore during drilling operations on the overall torsional
vibrations of the BHA. The BHA was modeled as a torsional shaft subjected to a localized external force due to the reamer cutting action, and a point load external force due to the drill bit interaction with the formation. The equation of motion was obtained using Hamilton’s principle, and modal expansion was used to solve the equation of motion. The results showed that the location of the reamer within the BHA plays an important role in vibrations response. It was found that vibration modes that exhibit symmetry within the reamer location show a negligible effect on the overall BHA torsional response. Reamers with aggressive cutters cause higher vibration response when compared with a drill bit with the same cutter aggressiveness. The simplified model reveals the significance of properly matching the drill bit and the reamer to reduce the overall BHA torsional vibrations.}

	abstract		= {Drilling Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage SAGD wells requires placing the lateral section of the producer parallel to the lateral section of the steam injector and within a predefined distance to maximize production. After one well is drilled and completed, the second well is drilled using advanced wellbore positioning techniques to keep the two laterals at specific distance in close proximity to each other.  Active Magnetic Ranging is frequently used for positioning of SAGD wells, whereby an electromagnetic source, such as a solenoid is run on wireline in the first well that has been drilled and distance and direction measurements are made using the MWD tool while drilling in the second well. This increases the complexity of the operation as there is requirement to convey the source tool on wireline in a horizontal well and solutions for doing this, such as a tractor or coiled tubing, add considerable expense.  Passive Magnetic Ranging PMR is a common technique to estimate the distance and direction between the two wells while drilling the second well, without any requirement to run wireline tools in the offset wellbore. However, this technique requires taking at least 10 stationary surveys every stand if not more. This conventional practice leads to significant additional rig time and often increases directional drilling complexity from hole washouts to stuck pipe events. Additionally, as the wells are drilling into each other from opposite directions, both wells have high lateral and vertical uncertainty. The close proximity of both wells and the resultant external magnetic interference makes surveying an additional challenge to the BHA design and well integrity.  This is the first worldwide application of drilling SAGD twin wells utilizing Definitive Dynamic Surveys DDS to save two hours per stand by eliminating all the rig times taking stationary surveys every stand for PMR as well as eliminating all the risk to the drilling operation due to the prolonged time of having the drill string stationary. In addition, it is the first time to run a solid-state Gyroscopic Measurement While Drilling GMWD tool to measure the accurate wellbore position of the drilling well. This had significantly reduced the uncertainty of the estimated distance and direction between the two twinned wells.}

A step-by-step methodological approach is presented, comprising environmental impact modelling of drilling and rig operational activities through application of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The method aims to break down upstream emissions to a process level, showing that emissions can be evaluated to a greater detail level compared to what current scope 3 reporting levels offer today. Results from a North Sea drilling case study conducted in collaboration with Noble Corporation are used for showcasing the impact burden levels, challenges and prosperity of accounting, reporting, and tracking upstream emissions as a drilling contractor. A framework tailored to the drilling industry is presented, emphasizing how upstream emissions may be linked to drilling and rig operational processes, and how these emissions can be continuously reported and improved over time. A set of system boundaries for assessing scope 3 emissions are suggested, along with recommended emission calculation methods. The presented framework may serve as an alternate supplement to IPIECA's adapted version of the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 Standard, otherwise intended for the petroleum industry, and to IADC's industry guideline for ESG reporting.}

When the drill bit breaks up formations, some of the energy dedicated to drilling is transmitted to the drill string as axial, lateral and torsional vibrations. Although these vibrations are affected by the drilling parameters, it has been experienced that vibration measurements can be used to evaluate formations during drilling a well. For this purpose a laboratory scale drilling rig was used to perform numerous experiments. During the drilling operations, several drilling parameters as well as vibrations with three-component accelerometers attached to the drill string were recorded continuously. Numerous uniform concrete and rock samples were drilled by a double roller cone bit. The uniaxial compressive strength of all concretes and rocks were measured prior to the experiments.  The tests were executed using different combinations of weight on bit and rotary speed.  For a subsequent evaluation statistical features were extracted in a first step from the recorded data in both, the time domain and the frequency domain. Those features formed the base for the formation classification by linear and non-linear models. Although linear models like Bayesian inference are not suited for that challenge, it turned out that non-linear models like neural networks provide excellent results in both, the training and the test data-set. Finally, the application of parameter selection methods showed that mechanical specific energy and rate of penetration in combination with higher order frequency moments of all recorded vibration types play the major role in the formation classification.},

	abstract		= {Occasionally, operations require setting a production liner on bottom. This could be unintentional, e.g. when the liner hanger slips fail to operate, or intentionally, e.g. when the liner is purposely run without a hanger to guarantee sufficient bypass area. A consequence of setting the liner on bottom is that the buckling force will be compressive, and assessment of the buckling severity is required to avoid high buckling induced dogleg severity (DLS). After the liner is cemented, the induced DLS is made permanent. Thus, this change in well path trajectory could jeopardize the runnability and installation of completion equipment.  In this study, the buckling induced DLS is estimated using a finite element based stiff-string model. The model takes in consideration the additional compressive loads of setting the liner top packer. It also accounts for liner centralization. It was found that this model overcomes the limitation of the theoretical models implemented in widely used commercial casing design software as it captures the physics of the buckled casing in between centralizers with more accuracy.}

	abstract		= {Vibration from High Frequency Torsional Oscillation (HFTO) damages drilling tools and electronics.  Destructive HFTO can occur in harsh drilling environments which reduces drilling performance and reliability and leads to non-productive time and associated costs.  Because it is faster, cheaper, more precise, and more controllable compared to field testing, a laboratory test environment is optimal for developing HFTO countermeasures. However, until now, a full-scale test rig that reliably generates controllable HFTO did not exist. This paper will describe for the first time a laboratory drilling rig that generates HFTO and, therefore, can be used to develop and qualify anti-HFTO procedures and tools.  To study the HFTO susceptibility of bit-rock interactions, the full-scale laboratory drilling rig consists of a mud circulation system, hoisting system, bit, and BHA coupled with high-frequency instrumentation to measure torsional vibrations on a millisecond scale. Finite element models (FEM) built to characterize the drilling simulator are used to correctly interpret the results of drilling data. An experimental modal analysis (EMA) is used to validate and refine the FEM models. Next, PDC-bits are used to drill several rocks under varying pressures, RPMs, and weights on bit (WOB). The resulting high-frequency torque and tangential acceleration data are compared to a checklist of necessary criteria to prove that self-excited HFTO occur in the lab. These measurements, when considered with their axial sensor positions, are used to reliably identify HFTO and compare bit-rock combinations by their susceptibility to HFTO.  Results of the FEM-models and the EMA agree on the characteristic mode shapes and dominant frequencies which match dynamic measurements. Recorded data show that self-excited HFTO are reliably excited when the criteria for self-excitation are fulfilled. Vibration energy is concentrated in one dominant mode, the vibration amplitude is scaled by the RPM, and the frequency of torsional oscillations is independent of the rig RPM. HFTO-prone rocks are identified using segmented rock specimen tests. The excitation mechanism in the laboratory test rig corresponds to the mechanism in the field. Stability maps show that bits differ in excitability allowing a comparison based on bit features and subsequent bit improvements. Methods and tools tested in the lab environment form a framework for developing anti-HFTO field solutions and operational guidelines.  The upgraded full-scale drilling rig reliably generates HFTO in a laboratory environment under realistic drilling conditions. When coupled with extended research into the combination of bit, rock and BHA variables that lead to HFTO susceptibility, this rig will enable faster and cost-efficient product and procedure development cycles for proven and validated anti-HFTO tools and field guidelines. An HFTO suppressing bit or an HFTO suppressing damping device will have a significant impact on BHA reliability, drilling performance, and reduced NPT.}

This article presents the concept of a supervisory/ advisory systems dedicated to support the detection of abnormal events and to provide guidelines for fluid treatment actions.  The proposed methodology consisted of two stages: experimental data acquisition in a flow loop and data processing for the validation of the algorithm. In the data acquisition stage, multiple properties of the drilling fluids were continuously measured by using automatic sensors. In the second stage, the drilling fluid's properties were processed in a fault detection algorithm. The algorithm used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to train the process model through the calculation of the principal components of the steady state of the fluid, which represents the healthy state of the drilling fluid.  Once the process was trained, the algorithm monitored new data samples obtained in the data acquisition stage and compared them to the trained model by calculation of the mean square prediction error (MSPE) of the model and the T{$^2$} of Hoteling. Persistent changes in MSPE and T{$^2$} values indicated that an anomaly was occurring in the drilling fluid. The new methodology was validated based on the data obtained in a flow loop where fluid properties were monitored using online sensor under different operational conditions. The algorithm was able to detect faults and anomalies in the drilling fluid even identifying the source of the anomalies through the decomposition of the MSPE and T{$^2$} statistics. The proposed algorithm performed well in real-time conditions, pointing out that it can be used as a diagnostic tool in-field oil well drilling operations.}

	abstract		= {SPE's Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) sponsors the Drillbotics® autonomous drilling contest to promote advanced learning at participating universities. Two groups working independently employed similar engineering, software, and control technology to detect and mitigate drilling dysfunctions. Both teams demonstrated understanding of engineering requirements coupled with hands-on experience to successfully deploy their designs.  One team created a control model that connected with an industry research entity's well model that included a variety of formations and downhole pressures based on data from previously drilled wells in the North Sea. The well control simulation was new to the competition, and the team successfully created a workable system. The team drilled ahead at optimal ROP, stopping for connections. They then had to recognize an influx and determine whether this should be handled with the MPD system or stop drilling and close in on the kick. The model monitored surface flow in and flow out and pit level and compared readings with a trend analysis based on one-second data. The kick detection module included a technique to minimize false positives using a higher kick threshold, first giving a warning, and then switching from conventional drilling to MPD, and finally closing in the well if necessary. The simulated kick occurred during a connection and was a small kick at a low influx rate. It was detected when drilling, but later than desired. A retest with a lower kick threshold was more successful.  A second team designed and built a remotely operated autonomous small scale experimental rig that included a working version of an RSS tool to steer the BHA along a predefined trajectory within a block of sandstone. The control architecture enabled the distribution of various drilling tasks to independent specialized operating algorithms. Despite the limitations of a 1.5-inch wellbore, the physical rig team constructed and implemented an RSS with three pads actuated mechanically from the surface. Accompanied by an enhanced bit design and a length reduction of the BHA by over 50\\% compared to the previous model, a build rate of 8 degrees was achieved in less than two feet measured depth. This effort resulted in the team's first successful application of the newly developed scaled RSS to autonomously drill a directional trajectory provided only minutes earlier. An externally applied electromagnetic field was used to measure the azimuth, while an accelerometer was used to measure the inclination to close the feedback loop for the steering algorithm.  Both teams had to solve common engineering problems, which may lead to the use of a physical rig to improve the fidelity of virtual models. Importantly, there is an increasing industry need to provide improved data interoperability, which is being met by this program. The achievements of both teams are important to the future of drilling automation, as they are first steps towards using these research tools to improve the creation of digital twins of full-scale rigs and to verify and validate interoperability of third-party apps prior to field release on land and offshore rigs.}

	abstract		= {Borehole quality is a crucial aspect of wellbore construction, impacting drilling and completion execution and long-term well reliability in terms of zonal isolation and casing integrity. However, developing key performance indicators and requirements for borehole quality has proven difficult since there are few direct measurements of borehole characteristics other than surveys.  This paper explores the use of ultra-high frequency acoustic borehole image logs and caliper measurements to develop methods to quantify effects during drilling operations, such as micro-tortuosity, salt creep, and other observed characteristics, which could prove useful in defining wellbore quality in the drilling phase. The role of the repeatable process of drilling a stand with different bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs as motorized rotary steerable systems (RSS) and conventional steerable systems (CSS) will be mapped to borehole quality impact with downhole measurements. Drilling operations and methods will be linked with the resulting borehole measurements and the relationship in terms of correlation and causality examined.  This case study documents the application of the processes and tools for vertical and lateral intervals of horizontal wells in the different basins of North America. Results of different states of drilling operations such as sliding, rotating, and reaming, drilling dysfunctions, BHA changes, drilling practices, and rock characteristics will be presented. The paper's conclusions use this approach to determine the needs and methods of wellbore quality measurement and requirements for drilling and completions and potential life of well implications.  This paper builds on the drilling mechanics process and downhole measurements to determine usable borehole quality key performance indicators that can be applied as additional wellbore quality management methods.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes the development of a novel wellhead load relief system improving operational aspects and wellhead fatigue management achieved by an unconventional utilization of existing equipment. The objective is to provide insight in a newly developed technology for Wellhead Fatigue mitigation with the potential to become a future element in fatigue management. The operational aspect is appealing as this system is effective with remotely operated hook-up and a minimum of additional equipment needed. The development of the system started in 2015 during planning of several exploration wells and have continued as a cooperation between the drilling and subsea disciplines within Equinor.  The Guidepost Well Load Relief (GP-WLR) seeks to be a load reduction and operational effective wellhead load relief system through integration of WLR functionality with existing BOPs and redirecting well load thru guideposts and subsea structures already present. The GP WLR system is modular which provides for flexibility in finding a way of adding it to legacy equipment. The basic idea of such a system is explained and then how the development has evolved internally in Equinor from idea, concept, prototype, and implementation. At this stage the GP-WLR technology has been used in operations by a subsea drilling Blow Out Preventer (BOP) and a Work Over stack. The effect and use of the system will be discussed in an operational perspective. The operation of the GP-WLR system is using remote access. Experiences gained during prototype testing and first-time use have shown that the GP-WLR system have worked as intended.  The authors believe GP-WLR to be a significant contribution to the wellhead fatigue mitigation toolbox while reducing the risk for damage to equipment and personnel.  GP-WLR will be a significant contribution to the wellhead fatigue management and allows optimizing drilling schedule while also reducing the risk for damage to equipment and personnel.}

	abstract		= {Managed pressure drilling (MPD) and managed pressure cementing (MPC) typically use lighter fluids than in conventional drilling. One consequence of this is that the fluid behind the casing being run and cemented is lighter than would be the case with conventional drilling. This has implications to the casing design for two reasons: the burst loads on the casing are augmented due to the lower external density profile, and the annular pressure buildup (APB) loads are different. It is important to consider these design implications while performing the casing design, particularly for deepwater wells. Unfortunately, this is not common at present, since the MPD/MPC design work and the casing design work are often distinct and separate, both physically and temporally. When the lower density external fluid from MPD/MPC is considered in the casing design, it is possible that the casing in question has to be upgraded (increased weight and grade) to accommodate the loads post MPD/MPC. This paper presents such a case, where the consequence of having drilled the section using MPD and cementing the casing using MPC was to upgrade the casing. The paper further presents a solution to this problem- modifying the MPC procedures such that a heavier mud than that used during MPD can be placed above the top of the cement behind the casing, thus mitigating the loads and eliminating the need for a heavier or higher-grade casing. The authors show how this can be achieved, by managing the densities of the different fluids and cement during the MPC operation. The authors hope that this work highlights the interconnectedness of well design and MPD/MPC operations, and engenders more interaction between the two groups during well engineering.}

	abstract		= {{PDC} drill bit performances in hard rock has been greatly improved during the last decades by innovations in PDC wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, distributing uniform wear along the profile and achieving high drillability and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area: drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid with the introduction of PDC cutters with chamfer and special shape.  This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied on the back of the cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the PDC characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and side rake angles, \ldots{}.) is presented.  The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration. Finally, full scale laboratory drilling tests and field results indicate that the use of accurate cutter rock interaction model can help the drill bit designer to find the best drill bit for a specific application. Standard laboratory full scale drilling procedures have been developed. The tests have shown that drillability, stability, steerability and wear can be improved and controlled by acting on the cutter characteristics, cutter setup, trimmer characteristics and gage type.}

	abstract		= {Operators in the Permian Basin have been performing two stage cementing operations on their casing strings for decades utilizing conventional diverter tool technology, often in combination with casing annulus packers.  Over time, issues with legacy diverter tools (DV) have been identified and solutions sought. These issues range from longer than desired time to drill-out the DV tool, reluctance to drill-out a DV tool with a directional assembly due to drill bit dulling and premature drilling motor/MWD failures, damage to the DV tool while drilling causing leaks and remediation, and an inability to pressure test the whole casing string after cementing. A development effort was made to eliminate these issues. The Hydraulic Port Collar (HPC) was designed and extensive qualification/testing of the HPC design was performed prior to field deployment. Running procedures were written and revised in consultation with a variety of operators. Several wells were identified for field trials. The wells were selected based on the operator’s desire to eliminate a DV tool drill-out. The wells had complex directional plans that required high bend drilling motors resulting in the operator’s reluctance to drill-out conventional DV tools with the curve BHA’s.  The hydraulic port collar functioned as designed on all field trials. Pressure readings from the cement trucks confirmed the tools opened within the calculated pressures and closed and sheared out within the calculated pressures. Full communication of compressed volume, from the float collar to surface was achieved, allowing the operator to perform a full string casing test. The wiper plug was mechanically confirmed as released from the HPC and subsequently pushed to bottom and drilled up when the shoe track was drilled out. Utilizing curve BHA’s with 2.12° to 2.38\textdegree{} bend motors, all wells were drilled and landed in the drilling window with one curve BHA run. As a result, dedicated DV tool drill-out runs were eliminated, no unusual damage or dulling of the curve BHA was observed and no post drill-out damage/leaks at the HPC were experienced. A review of the field trials showed efficiency gains up to 40\% when compared to previous operations where legacy DV tools had been deployed. These trials confirm that the novel Hydraulic Port Collar can increase operator efficiency in wells that require two stage cementing operations.  This paper will document case histories and lessons learn to date.}

	abstract		= {Increased digitalization in industry has brought forth a myriad of applications for data science and analytics over the past decade. As needs for advanced modeling and analytics have grown, this onshore drilling contractor embarked on a journey to centralize data acquisition, aggregation, transmission, and modeling into one platform located on-location.  This paper explains how the combination of both data exchange and modeling has allowed for the development of three novel controls applications that are combinations of traditional programming and industrial control logic. This opens doors to make advanced data science modeling, such as machine learning and online learning, available directly to existing rig control systems that do not have these capabilities.  The flexibility of this system offers significant opportunity for applying advanced analytics and data science tools at the rig site. Rig control systems are no longer limited by traditional industrial controllers but have the ability to interface with performance applications written in traditional programming languages. Applications running on our edge servers, integrated as input/output to the control systems, removes the limitations of the PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and allows us to ``modernize'' our control system without having to replace existing PLCs.}

	abstract		= {At times during the lifetime of an oilfield well, there is a need to establish or rectify a barrier by using the perforation-wash-cement (P/W/C) remedial procedure. Evaluation of the P/W/C interval is carried out by sonic and ultrasonic logging tools. Depending on perforation hole size in the casing the bond log quality can be affected, rendering the logging results invalid or qualitative only. Knowledge gathered in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has allowed for improvement in techniques and data processing workflow for the P/W/C procedure.  The toolstring is reconfigured to acquire data at the highest resolution possible across an optimized logging interval. Originally, the procedure was standard cement evaluation, but through experience, the logging and data processing methodology has been improved to better accommodate the challenges posed by the P/W/C environment. Acoustic impedance images are processed with an advanced methodology widely used for open hole geological images. It applies linear feature reconstruction (inpainting) and a texture reconstruction algorithm in a multipoint statistical approach to predict data behavior in the perforation-affected interval. Different processing options are available, allowing comparison to select the most representative result.  Behind the casing, cleanup efficiency depends on many parameters, including perforation design. The log data quality is greatly influenced by the density of the perforation shots, the entrance hole size, and perforation pattern. To evaluate the cement, a centralized toolstring, speed-corrected depth, and high-resolution datasets contribute to obtaining a highly detailed cement map of the annular conditions across the P/W/C intervals. This allows the implementation of further processing to strengthen the possibility of accurately reconstructing the acoustic impedance maps to provide the operator with an informed evaluation of the cement status. In multiple cases, the bond quality of the annular contents prior to the P/W/C operation have been logged to establish a baseline and make a proper pre- and post-evaluation, and such logging is recommended. In addition, blank sections due to gun connections across the perforated intervals allow an additional check to the overall log quality.  Lessons learned from P/W/C logging were shared in the NCS across multiple operators and globally.}

	abstract		= {In oil wells, operators must prove the presence of a barrier behind multiple casings, which is expensive as they need to remove pipes and evaluate a single casing. To reduce cost and carbon emissions, we implemented a solution that involved logging through tubing to evaluate both the condition behind the tubing and the barrier behind the second pipe, while satisfying NORSOK D-10 guidelines for single-casing evaluation.  A combination of ultrasonic and sonic tools was deployed within the tubing. The ultrasonic measurements provide detailed understanding of the annular content behind/around the tubing versus depth along with position of tubing in the casing. The sonic measurements, with lower frequencies, have a greater depth of investigation and thereby evaluate the presence of any solids behind the second pipe. Extensive modeling and laboratory experiments of dual-string configurations in our research facility along with multiple sets of field data helped determination of the presence of solids using both ultrasonic and sonic measurements.  Two wells, a water injector, and an oil producer, were intervened via intervention tower in the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). For the injector well (7-in. tubing and 9 5/8-in. casing), dual-string evaluation results were compared with the first bond log along with extended leakoff test. For the producer well (5 1/2-in. tubing and 9 5/8-in. casing), dual-string evaluation results were compared against a single-casing validation log. The validation log provides a strong degree of confidence in the dual-string evaluation results. Data from the dual-string evaluation and single-casing log will be used to generate a machine learning model for this well geometry, fluids, cement, and formation and is expected to give another high-resolution azimuthal prediction, which would allow for even higher confidence in the answers in later operations with the possible elimination of the need for a validation log.  This paper discusses an offshore case study where the technology was used in two wells in the NCS. The results and observations with dual-string logging technology will be presented in addition to the validation result after pulling the inner tubing. These dual-string log measurements were then used to streamline the sidetracking program, resulting in cost saving due to offline rig activity and minimizing contingency operation, rig time, and scope while reducing overall carbon emissions.}

This paper provides an overview of how cross-industry application of machine learning (ML) technology helped solve challenges related to real-time pattern recognition of breakover and how this solution assisted with providing immediate metrics and control of the drilling process.  This project leveraged Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), used frequently in other industries for speech recognition and pattern recognition over time series data, to create a statistical classifier that detects drillstring breakover in real time. Although these techniques have not seen widespread adoption in the oil and gas industry, they provide a flexible solution to many automation problems. Model features correlated with string stiffness were constructed that allowed for accurate classification of pre-breakover and post-breakover states. Subject matter experts were enlisted to label 500+ examples of breakover, which were used to train and test models for both ascending and descending drillstrings. The models were then deployed and integrated into the drilling control system to provide monitoring capabilities and control certain processes.  The models provided accurate detections of breakover more than 90\% of the time when measured against several wells studied for this project and provided hookload values for both breakover and general pickup and slackoff operations. This high accuracy allows for broad application of the model to several use cases. Applications include reducing an operator's 20-ft standard pickup distance, thereby reducing overall connection times, and using the associated models improved the quality of tares in deep lateral sections. The model also provided additional benefits, including automated drag monitoring for rotary drilling and tripping as well as hole condition monitoring during cleanup cycles. Both offer opportunities to optimize flat time and will be discussed in detail.}

	abstract		= {Representing the first-generation high-performance water-based drilling fluid, KCl/Polymer drilling fluids are widely used to drill troublesome shale formations containing water-sensitive clay minerals. In addition to maintaining wellbore stability, its rheological properties also play a crucial role in enhancing overall drilling performance. An accurate description of the rheological behavior of drilling fluids is essential in optimizing drilling fluid hydraulics. This study evaluates traditional and novel optimization algorithms for the parameterization of rheological models using an extensive field rheological database of KCl/Polymer drilling fluids. An objective function based on a symmetric mean absolute percent error is used in parameterizing rheological models. Golden Section Search (GSS), Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG), and Trust Region (TR) methods are used as new alternatives to traditional Gaussian-Newton (GN) and linear/semi-linear regression (LR/QLR) methods. As a more statistically plausible criterion, the symmetric mean absolute percentage error is also used to measure the goodness of fit of rheological models with datasets. It has been shown that GRG and TR algorithms outperform conventional methods in finding optimal model parameters. The three- and four-parameter models fitted the rheological data best, with a more uniform symmetrical error distribution than the two-parameter models.}

	abstract		= {Wellbore instabilities and mud losses lead to costly and time-consuming drilling issues. The identification of these drilling risks is inevitable when it comes to estimating time, costs, and the success of wellbores for exploration and production in reservoirs. The goal of this study is to assess drilling integrity and enhance drilling program designs for forthcoming wells in the reservoir located in the Matach\'{\i}n Field, Colombia based on a high-resolution 4D geomechanical model and incorporated natural fractures. The study involves examining the prediction of natural fractures and stability of wellbores during production scenarios, with the aim of minimizing non-productive time in future wells, irrespective of their trajectories.  An advanced geomechanical workflow was developed in four stages. The first stage involved gathering all data through a screening process. The second stage was data integration, which involved constructing a structural model by incorporating geological attributes and single well profiles, including geomechanical parameters, stress distributions, and pore pressure. In the third stage, present-day stresses were analysed, and their evolution was examined due to changes in pore pressure from the reservoir model and imposed tectonic strains. The fourth stage involved analysing stresses, elastic and rock strength properties for field integrity, drilling integrity, discontinuity stability analysis, and optimal well placement ultimately incorporating natural fractures. Geomechanical properties and stresses were derived from wireline logs at well scale and calibrated against available measurements, such as rock core tests, formation tests, and wellbore deformation analysis. Dynamic pore pressure data up to present-day were included to assess stress changes caused by depletion. The results of 1D geomechanical analysis were upscaled into 3D and incorporated into a complex structural grid along with fault and discrete fracture network models.  The 3D model shows that well trajectories can be improved for increased wellbore stability, resulting in a significant decrease in predicted wellbore collapses. Pore pressure changes that occur due to depletion (production) are explicitly reflected in the reservoir section. As one of the first 3D geomechanical studies in the Colombian Matach\'{\i}n field, the model provides a robust subsurface stress distribution that allows conclusions on safe and optimal well placement. The 3D model serves as the basis for future studies to incorporate new information available from well data and laboratory data. New geological and seismic interpretations allow for an extension of the model area to yet unexplored regions.}

	abstract		= {Targeting deep reach laterals in vibration prone interbedded abrasive sandstones requires multiple bits to complete the prolific pay zones in Central USA. Excessive cutter wear coupled with extreme torque fluctuation in such targets results in reduced ROP and premature failure of BHA components. Early POOH leads to 24 to 48 hours of non-productive time due to BHA tripping. This puts huge economic risk on such challenging pay zones. This study exhibits detailed analysis of downhole and in-bit sensing data to increase the operational stability window enabling enhanced bit durability and smoother drilling conditions for economic drilling of long laterals.  The proposed bit's operation optimization framework is built using a detailed analysis for an in-bit high-frequency sensing gyro and accelerometers data correlated to the geo-steering unit vibrational and Gamma-ray data. The data analysis identified High-Frequency Torsional Oscillation (HFTO) prone formations and HFTO event frequencies, amplitudes and durations while drilling through lithologies with different rock strengths. The findings from the analysis of the field data are cross referenced to the bit response in lab experiments using in-bit sensing while drilling custom built rock cores under high confinement pressure. The result of this work is used to accurately model the drill bit performance to develop best practices to operate them. An operational stability map and a drilling guideline were built and communicated with the region for longer reach and stable drilling.  The data analysis showed a correlation between the lithology shaleness factor and the bits susceptibility to trigger HFTO among other vibrational events. The higher the shale content on the GR track the lower the HFTO excitation probability. These findings were mirrored in the lab while drilling interbedded cores at high confining pressure and it was used to calibrate our drilling models for bit optimization. The application of the drilling guidelines on operating 9 bits resulted in a total savings of \\$500K per well and 4 days less of non-productive tripping. The guided drilling practices increased the drilled footage per bit by 50\\%, while reaching the same dull state as previous runs. The control of the bit HFTO and vibrational response decreased the frequency of premature BHA equipment failure enabling longer intervals and less unnecessary tripping.  The absence of wire line logging in long reach laterals limits the understanding of targeted zones. This framework enables gaining deeper formation insights that unlock the optimization of capable drill bits. The adoption of such practice is promising longer footage per bit, less downhole vibrational issues, and economic completion of challenging interbedded abrasive across the world.}

	abstract		= {Longer wells and increasing complexity of the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) are causing drilling operations to become harder to achieve. Combined with strict timelines and the demand for higher rates of penetration (ROP), the entire drilling system operates at its physical (loads, bending moment, etc.) and operational (drilled formation, drilling parameters, well path, etc\ldots{}) limits. Exceeding these limits can induce excessive drilling vibrations and dysfunctions like whirl that can be harmful for bit, bottomhole assembly, reaming device or drillpipe. Neglecting operational limits can therefore lead to damage, wear and tool failures that ultimately result in nonproductive time (NPT) and higher cost.  Additionally, the number of reaming operations increases. The added challenge of complex reaming operations demands supplementary planning effort. In this paper, the authors focus on prejob and post-well analysis using simulation and modeling techniques. The result of the analysis leads to optimized reaming and drilling practices that are further elaborated following close interaction with field personnel. Applying the improved drilling practices result in best-in-class performance and lower nonproductive time.  In-house dynamics simulation software is used to calculate the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the BHA. Differences in BHA setup are associated, critical excitation sources identified and forced response analysis results compared.  Data from various deployments of a high-end rotary steerable system (RSS) BHA with a reaming device are analyzed and used to validate the simulation results. The data is derived exclusively from a massive salt section (similar formation being drilled) to lessen the formation’s influence on drillstring dynamics.  Incorporation of sophisticated simulation tools plus the close cooperation of field personnel resulted in excellent operational and drilling performance. In today’s challenging drilling applications, the insights gained have highlighted further opportunities for delivering optimal performance, and further assuring bit, BHA, reaming device and drillstring integrity.}

	abstract		= {Drilling hard stringers that are erratically distributed in an underlying rather soft formation is challenging from different perspectives. An unforeseen change of the drilled formation from soft to hard and dense rock can cause impact damage to the bit, deflect the bottom-hole assembly (BHA), result in high bending loads, increase vibration, and cause wear/tear on BHA components. If not properly managed, this leads to non-productive time (NPT) and increased maintenance costs. Further, a deflection caused by a stringer away from the planned well path that is detected late results in high local doglegs (HLD) and requires time-consuming correction through reaming with invisible lost time (ILT).  Recently, a stringer detection method based on vibrations, namely high-frequency torsional oscillations(HFTO), has been presented. A case study with 21 sections in the North Sea based on this solution is shown that demonstrates a reduction in ILT by 80\%.  The system is based on a timely and reliable detection of stringers, an optimized mud pulse telemetry scheme, and an automated advisory system. The downhole algorithm embedded in a measurement while drilling tool is consistently interpreting HFTO based on tangential acceleration and dynamic torsional torque measurement. By defining thresholds for the amplitude and the localization with respect to frequency content of HFTO, the algorithm results are translated into a binary value with 1 \textendash{} stringer currently drilled or 0 - no stringer is drilled. The low bandwidth consuming 1-bit value and downhole measured bending moment are sent in 10 to 15 second intervals to the surface by mud pulse telemetry. Once the stringer is detected, the bending moment data is closely monitored to react correctly and efficiently to a stringer indifferent scenarios.  This solution is discussed in a case study in Norway covering 21 sections with and without the system deployed. The offshore application is challenged by frequently occurring stringer layers and nodules of different geometry. Based on the stringer content, the reaming time has been typically high in this application. The system, however, enabled a timely detection of the stringers and an optimal stringer drilling enabled by the frequently sent bending moment information. Therefore, stringer drilling was done without having to pull off-bottom frequently and ream the transition area between soft and hard formation thereby saving time and reducing wear on the BHA and drill pipe, ultimately ending up with a smoother/straighterwellbore.  By using the system, a faster reaction to any stringer and the use of appropriate parameters to avoid costly HLDs are achieved. The case study demonstrates a significant and consistent improvement in ILT.  The reaming hours per 1000 m as a benchmark have been reduced from 2-5 hours without to 0.3-0.6 hours with the system resulting in an average saving of 12 hours per reservoir section.}

	abstract		= {High-frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is a particularly damaging vibration phenomenon that occurs while drilling HFTO-prone rocks with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits and aggressive drilling parameters. Mitigation or load reduction strategies are based on weight on bit or bit rotary speed reduction and are associated with lower rate of penetration and therefore limit the drilling efficiency. This paper discusses the suppression of HFTO with a 4.75-inch tool size damper assembly that is placed above the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and typically below the mud motor. The efficiency of the damper assembly is discussed in a case study with more than 40 runs in Permian Basin targeting different applications, environments, and formations, giving further evidence that providing damping to the BHA can completely mitigate HFTO.  The damper tool is designed for the purpose of mitigating HFTO. Inputs for the design of the inertia-based damper elements are the required damping identified from high-frequency downhole measurement data, laboratory testing and modeling to analyze and optimize the damping principle incorporated in the tool, and numerical simulations to analyze the achievable damping in different BHAs. The tool design is robust as proven in a standard process of tool reliability tests including rotating bending, vibration, temperature, and pressure, and not limiting the drilling parameters. The deployment is preceded by a step that maximizes achievable damping in the deployed BHA enabled by an optimization algorithm and numerical modeling. Herein, the damper elements are optimally placed for the identified critical modes of HFTO, targeting a placement in antinodes of the mode shapes with high vibration amplitudes guaranteeing a high damping effect.  The case study incorporates more than 40 runs in NAL showing that the occurrence of HFTO is reduced significantly in different applications. The case study includes back-to-back runs with similar BHAs with and without the damper assembly in different HFTO prone applications proving the efficiency of the tool in mitigating HFTO. Consecutive runs in the same well and formation using other vibration mitigation tools show a significantly higher HFTO-suppression rate with the damper assembly. The overall performance gain by use of the damper is further proven by a statistical evaluation and in comparison to the second and third best performing vibration mitigation tool, showing significant increase in all relevant performance metrics, including, but not limited to, Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) and Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). BHAs with the new damper tools outperform BHAs with industries currently preferred commercial vibration mitigation tools by as much as +100\\% in MDBF and +100\\% in MTBF.  The case study shows that HFTO can be mitigated by use of the new 4.75-inch damper assembly. The damaging HFTO that held back the drilling parameters is suppressed which enables a step change in drilling efficiency and reliability, which ultimately leads to a significant decrease in drilling cost.}

	abstract		= {Achieving optimal performance during drilling of complex well trajectories is often hindered by downhole drill-string vibrations and stick-slip. These can lead to drill bit and downhole tool damage, drill-string wear possibly leading to a twist-off, or formation damage. Recent advancements in drill-string vibration interpretation show that the sources of excitation are not only at the bit but anywhere along the string. Therefore, a solution that uses distributed along-string damping elements based on magnetic damping is investigated. This paper presents the design principles of a laboratory-scale setup to verify the concept and the accompanying test results.  Previously published numerical results show that stick-slip can be attenuated using the distributed damping elements. The elements attempt to reduce drill-string vibration by attenuating the sources of negative damping, and by increasing the sources of positive damping. Mechanical friction between the drill-string and the borehole, a major source of axial and torsional vibrations, is reduced, and its axial and tangential components are decoupled. Magnetic viscous damping is introduced by utilizing eddy current braking at the level of each element.  A laboratory-scale setup consisting of a 10-meter-long horizontal apparatus has been constructed to verify the damping effectiveness of an individual element. The setup was designed to mimic downhole drilling conditions such as drill-string elasticity, friction forces and inertial moments, and to recreate real-world adverse conditions such as vibrations, stick-slip, and twist-off. Sensors and actuators positioned along the experimental setup allow control of the rotational and axial velocities, contact forces at various locations, and adjustment of the magnetic braking force. Stick-slip was introduced in the system through an adjustable side force imposed on the drill-string as well as through a stepper motor operating in torque mode simulating the bit-rock interaction.  The first series of experiments in the laboratory-scale setup were aimed at evaluating the braking force obtained in different operating conditions. By controlling the strength of the eddy current effect, the magnitude of the braking force could be varied, and thus, the damping effectiveness of the element could be estimated. The braking force, measured by a load cell, was found to increase linearly with the rotational speed and with the strength of the magnetic field. The second round of experiments were focused on demonstrating how the magnetic braking effect helps damping out torsional vibrations and mitigating stick-slip.  A novel concept for damping stick-slip vibrations using magnetic damping elements distributed along the drill-string has been implemented and demonstrated at laboratory-scale. This concept aims to mitigate stick-slip vibration by addressing its root cause, the friction forces along the drill-string. The experimental setup can also be used to prototype and test new control strategies for damping of drill-string vibrations.}

	abstract		= {With continually increasing drilling costs, the importance of utilizing existing slots in offshore platforms has never been higher in increasing average rate of recovery from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Utilizing existing slots for new targets that were once inaccessible due to a multitude of reasons including technology limitations, value justification, among others pose many challenges for the operator.  One of these challenges specifically relates to compliance with current well design criteria and barrier requirements. As our industry has evolved, more stringent design criteria and additional well barrier requirements ensuring well integrity have become commonplace. In addition, integrity reduction of previously installed downhole components must be accounted for. Utilizing casing strings and polished bore receptacles (PBR's) that have been installed and exposed to harsh downhole environments for 20 + years create a need for innovative solutions.  Through this paper we will demonstrate how through proper planning and equipment selection the operator was able to successfully install a gas tight mechanical casing annulus packer in a tieback string. This provided mechanical isolation of the previous casing string that had been exposed to years of wear. Traditional solutions of a tieback seal stem stung into a PBR were not possible due to expected condition of the seal surface in the PBR from years of down hole exposure. The rigorous qualification and validation program of the packer led to its selection in this application. Acceptance criteria of ISO 14310: V0 was used as the basis for testing. This included testing in a casing joint that had been previously installed in a well for 25+ years, mimicking downhole environments for this application.  The annulus packer was installed integral to the tieback casing and activation was combined with subsequent installation of multi-lateral junction equipment. Requiring no dedicated runs for installation or activation provided additional value for the operator. The packer was tested as per well design criteria which allowed the operator to proceed with well construction and continue to new target with upmost confidence in barrier compliance and well integrity.}

	abstract		= {Drilling optimization is a complicated multi-objective processing optimization problem. During drilling, drillers need to adjust WOB and RPM continuously in a timely manner, not only to maximize ROP, but also to prevent severe vibration and maintain downhole tool durability. In this study, a virtual drilling agent using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model is developed and trained to automatically make drilling decisions and proven to effectively optimize drilling parameters.  A deep RL model using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is developed to optimize drilling process. In RL model, the reward of drilling decisions at each drilling step is a function of drilling ROP, downhole vibration tendency, bit dull state, and risks of tool failure. Separate modules to evaluate the reward of each component are implemented and trained using field and laboratory data. Deep RL model is applied and tested comprehensively on different drilling environments including hard and abrasive rock, embedded rock, vibrational vs. stable drilling. The hyper-parameters of the actor-critic NN architecture in RL model are carefully selected to improve the model convergence.  Results show the deep RL model can effectively find the optimum drilling solutions in various drilling environments. In soft formation, RL model applies the upper limit of WOB and RPM throughout the drilling depth to maximum ROP and reduce drilling time. In hard and abrasive formation, RL model gradually changes RPM and WOB to prevent the pre-mature wear of PDC cutters. The change of the drilling parameters is optimized based on rock abrasivity and target drilling depth. In unstable drilling environment, while RL model limits the ratio of WOB and RPM to avoid stick-slip vibration, simultaneously, the WOB and RPM is controlled to maximum ROP to drill to TD. In embedded formation, RL model successfully found the optimum solution by adjusting WOB/RPM to avoid stick-slip and overloading of bit cutting structure. The learning process of RL model shows hyper-parameter selection plays a critical role in model convergence and accuracy. Improperly selected hyper-parameter in RL model can lead to the failure of solution searching or sub-optimum solution. Overall, the RL model is approved to effectively find optimum drilling solutions in the various drilling environments and can be applied for both pre-well drilling planning and real-time drilling optimization.  To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop deep RL model for drilling optimization by implementing a combination of ROP, vibration, bit dull, and durability in the reward function. The proposed RL model can be extended to include more reward factors in the drilling optimization such as whirl and high frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO), stuck pipe, tool temperature and so on. The RL model can be applied for both pre-well drilling planning and real-time drilling optimization.}

	abstract		= {A well intercept operation has the scope to drill into an existing well. Similarly, some infill drilling operations are conducted with the scope of avoiding interception with other wells. A prototype of a tool for Active Magnetic Ranging While Drilling (AMR) without the use of a separate wireline operation has been developed. The main scope of the current article is presenting the results of a series of prototype tests of this tool in test wells.  The ranging tool emits a low frequency alternating current into the formation to reach the target well, and then run through that well's casings and back to the well being drilled. This electric current set up a variable magnetic field that is measured by the AMR tool determining the direction towards the target well as well as the distance.  In case of drilling a relief well, 10 - 25 wireline runs are needed before the target well is intercepted. The present AMR tool is fully integrated in the drill pipe and, thus, no wireline operations are required, and all the tripping operations are avoided.  A prototype of an active magnetic ranging tool on the drill pipe has been developed. This tool is outlined in the paper. Most focus will be given to a performance test conducted in a research well in Norway. Different pipes with controlled earthing are placed in neighbour wells to the well with the logging tool. The AMR tool was run in one of the research wells and the direction and distances to other target wells were measured. The set-up and the results of this logging operation that was conducted on the drill pipe is described in detail. It is described how the direction and distance between the two wells are measured using the tool.}

	abstract		= {Drilling operations generate a wealth of digital data that can be examined to improve efficiencies. Downhole high-frequency accelerometers and gyro sensors have been around for years but were typically used to study single well intervals. Sensor data, matched to surface measurement, is being more routinely captured across multiple wells as costs have decreased. The authors have developed a platform and workflow allowing experts to use the downhole data native resolution easily. The authors will systematically use data analysis to link drilling dynamics and downhole tool function to system design, automated rig processes, and operating parameters.  The downhole sensor data, surface drilling data, and other relevant time-based and depth-based data streams must be cleaned, synced, and combined to provide a single source of data. This is not a trivial step due to various data quality issues such as sensor clock resets. The combined data is then loaded into a web-based viewer designed to allow for analysis at the native resolution of each data stream. The operator followed this process on ten wells of a new well design with a larger horizontal hole size to benchmark and improved performance in the horizontal interval.  Managing data of this size is not often in the realm of drilling expertise, leading to unusable or lost datasets. Data consistency, timeliness, and accessibility are essential to engineers and analysts but are often lacking. The net result is that engineers can't exploit the full resolution downhole sensor data, often causing analyses to end up with few answers. Many drilling phenomena like micro-stalling of the motor and high-frequency torsional oscillation are only identifiable with high-resolution downhole data. The operator used the described platform and workflow to find and characterize the drilling limiters in the drilling system and extends work first described in SPE 204099. Examples depicting downhole tool function, including failures, will show how downhole information is used to interpret surface observations and diagnose the drilling limiters at play over the wells.  Capturing and structuring high-frequency downhole sensor data builds on the traditional approach of drilling optimization using surface parameters and shock statistics. A dataset for analytics allows engineers and service companies to monitor downhole shocks and vibrations across wells and evaluate their effects concerning drilling parameters and procedures. Metrics beyond simple shock and vibration levels better assess drilling performance as the view into the downhole environment becomes clearer.}

	abstract		= {In this paper, we introduce innovative laboratory equipment, the high-temperature, high-pressure sag cell (HTHP-SC), designed specifically to measure the static settling of weight material under actual downhole conditions. high-pressure testing to assess drilling fluids’ weight-material suspension is not new in the drilling fluids industry. However, the HTHP-SC is an advancement in the field of drilling fluid testing equipment because its design improves measurement accuracy, and because it is compatible with current cementing consistometers and curing chambers. This compatibility enhances its utility for evaluating drilling fluid performance, especially high-performance invert emulsion fluids under field pressure and temperature regimes.  Accurate measurement and thorough fluid property evaluation are of paramount importance to customize the design of the drilling fluids to ensure their performance under particular drilling envelopes. Therefore, simulating actual downhole conditions in the laboratory becomes instrumental in improving the prediction accuracy of fluid performance under actual drilling scenarios. This approach is invaluable as it enables a better understanding of the dynamics involved, helping to optimize drilling fluid properties and additives for improved outcomes.  It is established that the types of additives used to formulate drilling fluids and the resulting fluid properties play a decisive role in weight-material sag performance of invert emulsion fluids. Failing to recognize this could result in a flawed fluid design, and ineffective fluid treatments during drilling operations that could potentially lead to fluid issues, impairing, in turn, the drilling performance. For this reason, a comparative analysis of low-pressure and high-pressure tests conducted up to a 7-day period is presented in this paper. The results demonstrate that low-pressure density measurements can greatly exaggerate settling compared to testing at actual well pressures and bottomhole temperatures, a behavior already recognized in the drilling fluids industry. However, with the attempt to shed more clarity on the reason for these measurements, we show in this paper that these significant differences in density measurements cannot simply be related to an increase in fluid viscosity caused by higher pressure, or a lesser expansion of the base oil, but principally to the type of rheology modifiers used. This insight is essential for selecting the appropriate chemistry for the rheology modifier(s) to achieve the desired fluid performance, based upon the drilling conditions, and to avoid overtreatments with these additives, which could lead to higher than desired equivalent circulating densities (ECD), surge and swab pressures, and pressures to break circulation. Furthermore, we present and discuss the dynamic sag performance of the fluids tested and compare it with the static performance.  In conclusion, we present low-pressure static and dynamic sag measurements, and high-pressure static results using a newly designed piece of laboratory equipment aiming to contribute to the understanding of weight-material sag under static and dynamic conditions when varying the type of rheological modifiers. We observed that the choice of rheology modifier is crucial for static sag behavior, with less distinct effects on dynamic sag tendencies. A combination of a clay-based modifier and an organoclay-based additive showed superior performance compared to fluids containing a copolymer latex and a polyamide. The findings from this study attempt to improve operational efficiency and safety in drilling operations. The HTHP-SC represents a step forward in the quest for an accurate assessment of the static weight-material sag potential, particularly in the context of high-performance invert emulsion fluids (HPIEF), or the so-called low-ECD fluids.}

	abstract		= {Stick-slip vibrations of drillstrings have been studied by researchers for several decades. The subject is gaining renewed interest as operating parameters for PDC bits have shifted to the stick-slip regime of higher bit weight and lower rotary speed for enhanced drilling performance. In Ledgerwood et al. (2010), stick-slip was identified as a primary cause of bit damage. The main objective of the current investigation is to answer the longstanding question: Do bit designs influence stick-slip behavior of the drilling system? Five prevailing industry perceptions reported in the literature are that anti-whirl bits, reduced exposure bits, and bits with bit-rock interaction number $\beta>1$ are less prone to stick-slip, while highly aggressive bits and worn bits are more prone to stick-slip. Although the phenomenological basis of these theories has been provided, validation in most cases is based on anecdotal evidence from the field. Data with diagnosis based on downhole measurements in a controlled environment are scarce. Consequently, conflicting opinions continue to exist about whether any of these theories work in reality.  To assess their validity, the five leading theories were reviewed and pairs of PDC bits were designed and manufactured. Each pair consisted of a bit with a standard design and a bit that embodied one of the theories. The bits were first tested in the laboratory to characterize their response. Full-scale wells were then drilled under controlled conditions using a research drill rig in Oklahoma. In these wells, only the operating parameters were varied while BHA, formation, and other variables were unchanged for a given bit pair. The downhole vibrations were measured with a new in-bit device and an industry-proven MWD vibration monitoring service.  The most important conclusion emerging from this study is that PDC bit design has a significant effect on stick-slip vibrations. While some of the theories held true, evidence from this study did not support others. The details of test results are provided and various aspects of bit design are discussed in an attempt to enhance the understanding of stick-slip mitigation.},

Expanding access to the internet using portable devices with high computing power has transformed the way people learn globally. This research collects and expands on work done recently by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) to advance the use of technology in well control training and competency retention. Experiences over the past five years illustrate that the necessity of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated acceptance for hybrid (combined remote and in-person) learning methodologies in the oil and gas industry. Studies into gamification over the past two decades show it has a statistically significant positive effect on cognitive, motivational and attitudinal aspects of adult learning. Synergized learning combining remote and in-person education with gamified learning systems present an opportunity to improve competency development and sustainment. Applying these learnings to develop both existing and new computer-based aspects of well control training and competency sustainment programs could improve well control competencies across the industry, thus enhancing performance in the critical process safety activities of upstream oil and gas operations. This paper summarizes two industry reports on these topics, presents detailed analytical findings of academic research into gamification, and recommends how to implement hybrid learning and gamification strategies to improve vital well control training and competency sustainment for the oil and gas workforce.}

	abstract		= {Nowadays, complex 3D trajectories are handled with a succession of circular arcs. Although they have constant curvature, their toolface is not constant. Consequently, directional drillers must adjust the toolface regularly to reach the target entry within its tolerances. This paper investigates the use of the constant curvature and constant toolface curve (CTC in short) as an alternative to the circular arc to facilitate the directional drilling work to reach the target entry within its boundaries.  The problem is addressed by calculating a safe operating envelope (SOE) to reach the boundaries of the target entry. The target entry tolerance is discretized as a polygon. From the current bit position and its direction, the possible choices of curvatures and toolfaces are obtained in order to reach the edges of the target entry shape. The SOE can be calculated with the circular arc or with the CTC curve. It is, therefore, possible to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both types of curves to attain the target entry and stay within its boundaries.  The circular arc is shorter than the CTC curve. However, it requires adjusting the toolface during the navigation, which is not the case with the CTC curve. As a result, the directional driller can easily control the bottom hole assembly (BHA) direction such that the well lands within the target entry limits by using set-points for toolface and curvature inside the calculated SOE. Furthermore, a new way to represent the SOE is introduced. It makes use of a 3D cylindrical representation where the curvature is mapped as the height of a cylinder, while the toolface corresponds to the azimuth in the cylindrical coordinate system, and the length is linked to the radial distance. This provides a visual aid to understand the SOE. Moreover, this visualization helps to appreciate the relationship of the initial bit location and direction in the construction of the SOE and how the margins increase in a particular manner as the bit approaches the target entry polygon.  The CTC curve is the natural one followed by directional positive displacement motors (PDM) or rotary steerable systems (RSS). Potentially, the CTC curve may be a door-opening solution to automated directional drilling control as it is easier to be followed by both PDM and RSS.}

	abstract		= {The characteristics of a drill string system have an essential influence on the performance of directional drilling. The appropriate control method of a drill string is important to drilling efficiency and downhole operation safety. Therefore, based on a new mechanical rotary steerable tool (RST), this paper aims to analyze the Dynamic Characteristics of RST in Directional Drilling. First, considering the thrust force generated by the RST and bottom hole assembly (BHA), the governing vibration equations of a drill string system are established. Furthermore, connected with fields drilling parameters, including the effects of a new RST on a drill bit and wellbore, as the boundary and initial conditions, the dynamic characteristics of a drill string system are compared and studied in directional and straight drilling. The results show that the axial vibration of the drill string increases extremely in directional drilling process, while the weight on bit (WOB) and inclination force change in small range. Moreover, the torque and azimuth force tend to be stable soon, even its initial fluctuations are significantly. Also, the new RST can effectively enhance the steering capacity, increase the drilling efficiency, and improve drill bit force performance. The research results can provide reference for developing directional drilling technologies, including related tool design and optimization.}

	abstract		= {Bit whirl is well documented as a major cause of damage to polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) drill bits and results in short runs, low rate of penetration (ROP), high cost per foot, poor hole quality, and downhole-tool damage. Hence, consistent lateral stability is highly desirable in PDC bits.  This paper presents a new method of producing PDC drill bits that reduce or eliminate bit whirl. Traditionally, attempts to design laterally stable PDC bits have assumed that the forces generated by the bit during stable drilling cause it to begin whirling. The new approach assumes that it is the response of the bit to forced motion off its center that causes whirl.  The new approach has been validated theoretically, in the laboratory, and in the field. Test results from a full-scale drilling rig indicate that this method is superior to existing methods at minimizing bit whirl.  This new method was validated successfully through an extensive field-test program undertaken in the northwest USA, involving high-speed downhole measurements from both conventional 7?-in.-diameter PDC drill bits and bits designed using this new method. The results demonstrated that the conventional PDC drill bits exhibited bit whirl throughout the run. The bits designed using the new method eliminated bit whirl completely.  The performance benefits of this new method were demonstrated in a 16-in.-bit section in a Middle Eastern field, where lateral vibrations are a significant problem. Before testing the new-method PDC bit, bit optimization led to the use of high imbalance force designs to minimize lateral vibration. The first test of the new method laterally stable PDC bit set field records for ROP, footage, and cost per foot compared with more than 50 runs with "antiwhirl" (Warren et al. 1990) designs, resulting in savings of more than USD 50,000 per run.  This paper demonstrates how use of the new method can eliminate whirl in both laboratory and field environments and deliver significant performance improvements over existing stability techniques.  This new method represents a significant step forward in the design of PDC bits to mitigate bit whirl, and it has been proved to reduce bit damage, increase run lengths, increase ROP, and deliver sizeable savings for operators.}

	abstract		= {High frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is still one of the most disruptive drilling dysfunctions we encounter. Vibrations are observed with fundamental frequencies as high as 400 Hz and torque sweeps from 0 to 7000 lbf-ft. The resulting damage includes drilling collar cracking, damaged electronics, and backed-off tools.  By measuring the amplitude and the fundamental frequency of this dysfunction, we present a model to characterize its drivers. This is a critical step in defining the mitigation strategies.  Although there are a multitude of drilling dynamics tools deployed to record these effects, the nature of HFTO, with large amplitude harmonics on top of the fundamental modes, means that simply deploying a sensor and data acquisition tool is not sufficient to characterize the dysfunction. There are critical requirements for these recorders in terms of sampling frequency and anti-aliasing filters, without which a unique interpretation of the dynamics is impossible.  We have a next-generation MWD tool that will detect HFTO. By calculating a fast fourier transform (FFT) in real time, it will also deliver a log of HFTO throughout the operation, that can be delivered to the driller in real time.  With this we have developed and demonstrated a suite of mitigation strategies. These are specific to the type of HFTO detected and include increasing the collar speed or reducing the WOB (for Type 2) or reducing the rate at which the WOB is increased (for Type 1). We also show that by changing the contact points on the tool to reduce the side force (friction), the operator can mitigate the Type 2 HFTO and achieve a considerable improvement on this drilling dysfunction and its impact.}

It will present field data where the actual amplitude of HFTO is a complex function of many parameters in which both drill-bit speed and weight on the bit are extremely significant. The HFTO amplitude will increase with both parameters to a peak and then a further increase will reduce the actual vibration.  To characterize these relations, a facility was built in our Research Centre in Cambridge, UK, to test HFTO in a laboratory environment. A torsional equivalent to a mass spring resonator was used. The facility allows for drilling under identical drilling conditions with HFTO enabled or disabled.  It will be shown that the origin of HFTO is at the actual cutting structure contact with the formation. The HFTO is not driven by the broadband bit drilling noise but by the actual bit cutter's interaction with the formation rock. It is these interactions that drive the speed and weight on bit (WOB) characteristics observed in downhole operations.  The characteristics and scale of the dysfunction are dependent upon the formation, the cutting structure, as well as the cutter profiles. This new knowledge will enable bits to be built that will alleviate HFTO rather than drive it.}

The RSS development testing was conducted in a challenging pocket of the Delaware Basin in the Permian Region of North America. This specific Delaware area has proven difficult to drill with conventional steerable motors due to rapid shoulder wear on the bit and sliding difficulties (Sugiura et al.2022).  The initial RSS BHAs were designed based on the directional objectives of the well. As the runs and wells progressed, the multiple embedded drilling dynamics sensor data, BHA/bit component wear and reliability, and drilling performance were all analyzed. From these learnings, systematic BHA changes were implemented and measured. This process continued until the drilling pace, reliability and repeatability were at an acceptable level for the project.  This paper details the drilling dynamics, drilling parameters, BHA configurations, formations, and logic for BHA/drilling parameter changes in the 12 $\frac{1}{4}$-in. intermediate section.}

	abstract		= {This study investigates the profitability of early sign detection of stuck pipes by considering the trade-off between reducing nonproductive time (NPT) through detection and increasing NPT through false alarms. Our objectives are to propose a hybrid approach combining physics-based knowledge and data science, analyze the timing of false alarms, improve the model to minimize false alarms, and evaluate profitability by quantifying NPT reduction.  Our proposed detection method combines physics-based knowledge and data science techniques, specifically capturing torque and standpipe pressure increases. First, we enhance the method by refining the model equation, learning method, and anomaly calculation method. Second, using field data from multiple wells collected over several months, we analyze the timing of false alarms and further refine the model to reduce them. Finally, to evaluate the profitability of our method, we examine the frequency of stuck incidents, NPT owing to stuck incidents, and NPT owing to false positives, and then quantify the reduction in NPT, considering both true-positive and false-positive rates.  By applying our method to 11 wells, we generated approximately 130 days of stuck risk output. By determining a threshold that detects 40\% of the stuck signs, we identified 37 false alarms. Analysis of these false positives revealed that nine could potentially indicate stuck signs, 23 could be disregarded by the operator or filtered out through data preprocessing, and five persist as challenging cases for the current method. Based on these findings, we further enhanced the model to reduce false alarms and successfully reduced the count to 11. In addition, our profitability calculation, based on NPT and considering the trade-off between true positives and false positives, demonstrates the potential for a reduction of several hours per year. Furthermore, implementing stuck sign detection is expected to lead to cost savings associated with bottom hole assembly losses, fishing, and sidetrack operations.  The novelty of our research lies in evaluating the profitability of early stuck sign detection by analyzing false alarms using multiple wells and long-term data. This analysis enables us to enhance the detection model and demonstrate the profitability of the proposed hybrid approach. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering both the true-positive and false-positive rates to enhance and evaluate the performance of early stuck sign detection methods.}

	abstract		= {Measuring the values of weight on bit (WOB) and differential pressure (DiffP) through accurate taring is critical for ensuring downhole tool health and creating accurate parameter roadmaps for drilling optimization. Current industry standards for taring rely on the driller to manually select a particular time when these values are zero, which is often imprecise and/or inaccurate. This paper will detail the journey this drilling contractor made to automate the taring process as part of a broader connection automation initiative, how initial solutions challenged organizational assumptions on downhole behaviors, and how a pattern recognition algorithm allowed for better tare consistency and accuracy over existing field procedures.  An initial process automation procedure was designed and implemented in the rig control system (RCS) to manage the connection process, starting with coming out of slips and ending with tagging bottom. As part of this process, the system included a step to consistently tare when the drill bit is one foot off bottom and descending at a constant rate. During field trials, this method gave encouraging results over previous manual tares. Though the result did show improvement over the traditional manual taring method, discrepancies in the relationship between WOB and DiffP eventually led to an improved method of taring which utilizes a novel pattern recognition algorithm. This algorithm detects when the bit tags bottom and establishes a reference hookload (HKLD) at that point. A pattern recognition algorithm was included into the automation sequence replacing the step to tare one foot from bottom.  The initial process automation routine provided consistency to the taring process which was observed during testing. The improvement in consistency revealed inconsistency in WOB tares which was supported by variance in DiffP when WOB was constant. A pattern recognition method was developed to identify when tagging bottom. This algorithm was applied to historical data providing evidence of its benefit to WOB tares. The algorithm was included in an application and then adapted and applied to DiffP tares. The application was run over a historical dataset to qualify its viability. After proving viability, it was exchanged with the taring step in the initial process automation routine and run on live wells. Taring using the pattern-recognition based application presented better results than the manual and initial automation taring methods. The overall operational impacts of each method will be discussed in further detail.  The results of this project challenge underlying assumptions about how taring should be performed and improves overall understanding of the impact of different automation routines. The pattern recognition method discussed in this paper constitutes a novel application which utilizes new technology to improve existing processes.}

	abstract		= {As part of the global effort to decrease emissions through the use of alternative fuels, the first ever use of hydrogen fuel in a dual-fuel engine on a drilling rig was successfully demonstrated in the Appalachian region. The process of safely managing hydrogen on site is described along with the effects on engine emissions and performance.  Prior to the in-field demonstration, initial testing was performed in a controlled environment to simulate the site conditions and confirm engineering modeling of combustion characteristics. The demonstration consisted of initial testing at 5\% hydrogen concentration and concluded with testing at 20\% hydrogen. New safety requirements were established with regards to how hydrogen was managed on site. No changes to the drilling program were made in order to validate performance using real-world conditions. The hydrogen was blended into compressed natural gas (CNG) on-site, which provided flexibility to adjust the properties of the fuel mix.  The demonstration successfully proved that the existing dual-fuel engines can support a blend of up to 20\% hydrogen without requiring any additional engine development, adjustments to the rig's control system, or hardware modifications. Transient re sponse of the engine was not compromised during load steps, load sheds, or gas shutoffs, even with the maximum hydrogen concentration. Aggressive engine substitution rates were maintained and a negligible change in engine efficiency was observed. Reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were observed to be directly correlated to the concentration of hydrogen in the fuel mixture. Although existing infrastructure needs to grow before hydrogen becomes an economically viable fuel for drilling applications, significant investment in the hydrogen industry indicates a future where hydrogen is a widely adopted source of energy. This demonstration represents an important first step to prepare for the hydrogen economy of the future.}

	abstract		= {This paper investigates the drill pipe twist-offs that occurred while drilling an S-shaped well in the 12-1/4" section. The presence of the 2nd mode shape of torsional vibration was observed and linked to the failure. Conditions that lead to a 2nd mode shape being triggered and sustained are discussed in addition to recommendations to prevent fatigue failures.  2nd mode shape torsional vibration is a standing wave with two nodes created along the drill string, with the first one being the top drive and 2nd located along the drill string. The drill pipe experiences the highest torque fluctuations in the rotational nodes during torsional vibration.  A high-resolution drilling dynamics recorder was utilized to record a spectrum of torsional vibration frequencies, confirming the presence of the 2nd mode shape of torsional vibration. The multiple degrees of freedom spring-mass model was used to identify the node location, which was later compared to the locations of the actual twist-offs.  The presence of the 2nd mode torsional vibration, its transition from the fundamental mode to the 2nd mode, and the conditions for the transition to happen were observed.  Recommendations were developed on how to recognize the 2nd mode shape with the surface instrumentation, on the drill string design, and preventive inspection.  Knowing the location of the node gives a possibility of selective inspection of the drill pipes once the 2nd mode shape was observed while drilling, minimizing the risk of fatigue failures. Also, the drill string design could be revised by increasing drill pipe strength within the nodes. The twist-off locations were found to match the calculated location of the node caused by the 2nd mode shape with a high degree of accuracy.}

	abstract		= {Accurate real-time modeling of downhole temperature (DHT) in high-temperature geothermal wells is crucial for proactive temperature management and preventing thermally induced drilling issues. While existing numerical models excel at precise DHT prediction, their complexity and long computational times render them unsuitable for real-time operations. This study introduces an innovative machine-learning model that overcomes these limitations, enabling real-time DHT monitoring in geothermal wells.  To create a robust dataset simulating DHT behavior under various drilling conditions in FORGE wells, we leveraged a sophisticated thermo-hydraulic model validated with Utah FORGE field data. This dataset, comprising thousands of data points, served as the training ground for a Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM) model. The DLSTM model, designed to capture the intricate non-linear relationship between DHT and drilling parameters, was fine-tuned using a Bayesian algorithm that efficiently optimized model settings based on past evaluation results. In a comprehensive evaluation, the model was rigorously tested against previously unseen scenarios to assess its strengths and limitations. Additionally, a parametric analysis was conducted to validate the model's predictions against established temperature management techniques reported in the literature.  Key findings indicate that variables such as DHT from previous time steps, mud type, and wellbore horizontal lateral length play pivotal roles in DHT estimation. The developed DLSTM model exhibits exceptional precision, stability, and generalizability in predicting DHT during both circulation and pump-off (no circulation) scenarios. Its architecture, featuring two LSTM layers with numerous cells, augmented by an additional hidden layer of artificial neural networks, effectively mitigates overfitting issues commonly encountered with conventional neural networks when dealing with extensive time-series drilling data. Across all scenarios, the model utilizes a 3-minute lag time of time series data to accurately simulate DHT in geothermal wells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) consistently below 1°C in most cases. Notably, the DLSTM model successfully captures the dynamic behavior of bottomhole circulating temperature (BHCT) and DHT build-up during pump shut-off periods in various drilling scenarios. Furthermore, the model's predictions regarding the impact of various cooling strategies on downhole temperature align well with the established understanding of temperature management techniques in geothermal wells.  Our developed machine learning model offers a reliable and automated solution for DHT prediction and real-time heat management in geothermal wells. It serves as a practical and significantly faster alternative to complex, time-consuming physics-based models. This research underscores the DLSTM's potential for capturing intricate time-dependent relationships between input features (drilling parameters) and outputs, opening avenues for its application in diverse drilling contexts beyond geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Eleven (``10 + 1") mechanisms of mechanical degradation that can compromise the wellbore integrity are evaluated by modeling the stress evolutions within the casing-cement sheath-rock formation (C/CS/RF) system. Past attempts from the published literature overlooked the need for establishing an initial stress state that yields stability following cement setting (wait-on-cement). A novel approach is used to calibrate for the initial stress distributions assuming effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity along the CS's interfaces with the steel casing and the adjacent-RF.  Established analytical expressions form what is generally recognized as the basic stress analysis inside the casing walls and the RF region adjacent to a well. A calibration procedure is necessary to extend the stress model into the CS layer between the casing and the adjacent-RF considering effective-radial-stress-and-displacement continuity. Our mechanistic model is capable of evaluating against four failure mechanisms in the casing layer considering collapse, burst, tensile, and/or compressive stress loads, four failure mechanisms in the CS layer (inner or outer debonding, radial cracking, disking, and shear cracking), along with longitudinal and transverse tensile/"Mode I" fracture initiation in the RF layer (an "underground blowout"), and finally potential reactivation via shear-slippage of natural, pre-existing faults at close proximity, that could trigger seismic events.  Post-blowout-reservoir depletion, followed by pressurization after successful capping stack shut-in presents one of the biggest challenges vis-à-vis wellbore integrity. A case study is presented, assessing the wellbore integrity during the aftermath of the MC 252-1 "Macondo Well'' blowout from April 20, 2010, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The results differ from those of previous studies and we think are more realistic due to the improved approach used for calibrating for the initial stress distributions. Wellbore integrity is maintained during the heavy-pressure depletion that the reservoir experienced throughout the 86.2-day post-blowout-discharge period and the subsequent wellbore-pressure buildup that followed the successful well capping.}

	abstract		= {Bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs were assessed in field trials for their ability to achieve critical low inclination requirements, while simultaneously enabling high drill rates. Because angle has historically been controlled by reducing weight on bit (WOB), these are often competing priorities. The use of real time surveillance of mechanical specific energy (MSE) provided unique insights into the bit dysfunction that occurs with many practices used to control angle. These quantitative insights supported the development of BHA and operating practices that maintained low angle while also achieving major gains in drilling performance.  The McGinness Hills field in Lander County Nevada is a geothermal operation with wells drilled in hard metamorphic and crystalline formations. Wellbore inclinations must be maintained below 2.0 degrees in the critical 20 inch interval in order to allow use of lineshaft pumps, which is challenging in the required hole sizes and rock hardness. Formation strengths are similar to petroleum operations in the Rockies and West Texas.  Pendulum and packed-hole assemblies were tested, and straight motors and slick assemblies were used for corrections. Well build rates were assumed to be controlled by the three-point curvature in the lower assembly and stabilizer placement was modified to control this curvature. The effectiveness of the curvature control as WOB was increased was evaluated from inclination measurements. Real time MSE analysis was used to manage bit operating performance and to determine the root causes of bit dysfunction.  The results demonstrated that packed-hole assemblies could be designed that controlled inclination while enabling 2-3 times higher WOB, and that the use of pendulum assemblies should be eliminated. Packed assemblies drilled 87\% faster. The increased WOB resulted in higher drill rates, major reduction in whirl and extended bit life, which are equally important performance objectives in hard rock drilling. The use of MSE surveillance allowed the physical processes to be understood deterministically, so that the philosophical design principles can be applied in other petroleum and geothermal operations.},

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry has for decades learned about safety from the analysis of failure, adverse events, incidents, and accidents. This approach is called ``safety-I". Safety-I has helped the industry reach a plateau of general high levels safety, measured as the absence of incidents, compared to other industries, but there is still room for further and continuous improvements. Researchers in human factors and safety have suggested that safety critical industries, in the future, should not only learn from failure, but also from the normal everyday successful work. This approach is called "safety-II" (Hollnagel et al. 2015), and, in a report from The International Association of Oil \\\& Gas Producers (2022), "learning from normal work". The paper describes the practical implementation and roll-out of safety-II and learning from normal work on board operating drilling rigs.  The learning from normal work project covers 3 phases:Phase 1: The onboard studies of positive practice, i.e., ethnographic observations of normal daily work and conversations with crew members, e.g., on the drill floor.  Phase 2: The development and prototype testing of learning material based on the onboard observations and training of onboard facilitators in the learning team format.  Phase 3: The final validation of the learning from normal work concept in a ramp-up case study on a rig starting a new drilling campaign.  More than 160 examples of positive practice from 5 different rigs (2 drillships, 2 jackups and 1 semisubmersibles) were collected in the first phase of the learning from normal work project. The examples illustrate how crews add safety to the process by, e.g., the way they communicate and interact, the way they use technology or the way they plan and discuss their work. The positive examples were filtered and used to generate learning material in the form of learning cards for interactive discussions of safety in learning teams and positive examples to be used in safety meetings and presentations for inspiration as an alternative to failure and incident cases.  One important conclusion from the learning from normal work project is that the crews contribute to the safety of the process through their behavior and small actions in the daily routine work. Thereby, they put many small "safety nets" in place in the system making it resilient and strong.  Looking at positive practice and positive events is new when discussing safety. It changes the narrative and the focus of the discussion from "what to avoid" to "what to do more" and "what to develop and support''. This philosophy is based on positive reinforcement as a motivating and driving factor.}

	abstract		= {Light density drilling fluids with hollow glass beads (HGB) are growing in applications for drilling depleted formations with minimal losses and increasing rate of penetration. However, there is a lack of studies on how best to utilize typical solids control equipment, as current practices and procedures based on barite weighted muds are inefficient. We report a systematic full-scale test program to study and optimize solids control efficiency with shale shaker, hydrocyclone and centrifuge with such fluids.  A non-aqueous-based hollow glass bead drilling fluid was formulated in the lab and a large batch ($>$40bbl) was prepared and tested using field scale solids control equipment. The inlet and effluent streams were monitored for density, particle size distribution, retort, rheology, and rheological properties and evaluated to determine the optimal equipment conditions to maximize solids control efficiency while minimizing loss of beads in the discharge stream. Variables included shaker screen sizes, flow rates and deck angles, hydrocyclone flowrates and operating pressures, centrifuge flowrates, differential speeds and other parameters. The amount of glass beads in the fluid was also varied.  The drilling fluid was contaminated with a variety of sized solids which mimic drill solids. Based on the data gathered, effective procedures were developed for monitoring hollow glass beads and drill solids in each stream. Through the systematic test program, conditions could be identified to achieve high solids control efficiency from the shale shaker, the hydrocyclone, and the centrifuge. This was achieved at hollow glass beads concentrations of around 11\% and 22\% by volume. While some previous field experiences had indicated severe challenges with centrifuge usage with these fluids, effective centrifuge operation could be demonstrated once the proper settings were identified. Overall, the testing results showed that most of the drill solids can be removed using conventional solids control equipment and fluid properties (e.g. rheology, fluid loss, etc.) can be maintained at desired levels without the loss of any significant amount of beads with the discharged solids.  Since the beads are lighter than base oil, their behavior in the solids control equipment is quite different from conventional solids. As such, equipment procedures and conventional settings had to be updated or changed. It was demonstrated that high solids control efficiency can be achieved even at high bead concentrations. This work addresses a barrier in the field application of these fluids and points towards practices that allow optimizing the application by minimizing drilling fluid dilution.}

The system comprises a rig site software application for creating and managing mix sheets, a machine learning algorithm that suggests chemical mixes based on fluid properties, a real-time sensor system for monitoring fluid properties, and an OPC-UA communication protocol for sharing a digital mix sheet with automation hardware systems.  The development of an automation system entails a comprehensive software application design that enables a gradual shift from manual to an automated workflow, fostering increased user confidence. The initial phase involved providing field engineers with the ability to manually create and organize the mix sheet. The second stage integrated a machine learning algorithm that allowed engineers to generate suggested mix sheets based on available products, current and target fluid properties. Once reviewed, the mix sheet is dispatched to an external automation solution for execution. Any changes made by the engineer to the suggested mix sheet are recorded to improve the algorithm. In the third phase, a real-time sensor system monitors and feeds data to the software, enabling the algorithm to generate a chemical mix in response to deviations or projected variations from target specifications. The use of OPC-UA communication protocol ensures versatility, scalability, and the seamless transmission of digital mix sheets to third-party automation systems.  The automation software system was tested in drilling fluid automation lab of Equinor located at Sandsli Automatic Drilling Fluid Laboratory, Norway with three objectives: 1) Demonstrate the usability in rig and remote operations scenario, 2) Communication with rig automation system, and 3) Verifying the algorithm output. The testing proved the viability of using the application and a seamless transition from manual workflows to automation. This also demonstrated the ability of the application to support remote operation by lowering the workload and improve efficiency. A water-based fluid system was prepared at the lab for testing the algorithm output validity. The generated mix sheet was published to the OPC-UA server hosted in the application. The accuracy of the algorithm has already been verified earlier in a lab experiment.  To conclude, the design of an automation system for the drilling fluid operations must consider the human factors, support rig and remote operations workflow and eventually capable of working in full autonomy. It must be able to communicate with other automation system via a standard, scalable and secure protocol like OPC-UA to ensure adoption. The solution developed for drilling fluid automation, the ML algorithm and communication methodology is novel in the industry and helps operators and service companies to improve service delivery quality, safety, and sustainability.}

This paper presents a method to increase the reliability of hole-opening BHAs by optimally matching the bit and reamer. The weight and torque distribution between the bit and reamer is predicted using a stationary load model. New quality load curves facilitate the evaluation of bit-reamer combinations in a user-friendly way. The model and the load curves are validated on a unique set of field data, enabling determination of the model's accuracy.  The model is based on the mechanical specific energies at the bit and at the reamer. The model assumes the RPM and rate of penetration to be constant, the BHA is rigid in the axial and torsional directions and the lateral movement is blocked. Quality load curves are deduced that depict the load distribution in one plot. The model is validated on a unique data set that includes several high-precision measuring tools placed along the drill string. The unconfined compressive strength over depth that usually is not measured in other runs is available. The data set enables precise determination of the axial forces and torques directly at the bit and at the reamer. The observed mechanical specific energy, drilling efficiency, and aggressiveness of both cutting tools over depth are measured.  The model and the quality curves are used to predict the weight and torque distribution depending on the formation type at the bit and at the reamer. A comparison of the prediction to the measured data shows that the weight distribution is predicted with an error of 2\% and the torque distribution is predicted with an error of 10.8\%. The model accuracy is determined by introducing uncertain parameters into the model. The load predictions are again compared to the measured data. Using the coarse parameter set, the mean prediction error increases to 13\%, which is very good, considering the simplifying assumptions of the model.  The validated model and the new quality curves enable an optimal choice of bit and reamers. The presented approach is fast and user-friendly and perfect for an application in advisory software in the well-planning phase. The increased reliability due to less mechanical overloads leads to reduced maintenance costs and less non-productive time of the reamer BHAs.}

	abstract		= {High-Frequency-Torsional Oscillations (HFTO) generate dynamic loads that can damage drilling tools, resulting in, for example cracks, twist-offs or broken electronics. They are triggered by the interaction of bits and rocks and force operators to reduce rotary speed (RPM) and weight on bit (WOB) losing drilling performance in the process. Recently, a full-scale drilling test rig was proven to generate verified HFTO behavior under laboratory conditions (Everhard et. al. 2023). This rig allows for a comprehensive study of the influences of bit characteristics on HFTO for the first time. This paper presents methods to qualify bit features to suppress HFTO. Effective HFTO influencing properties are identified and discussed.  The full-scale laboratory test rig drills rocks in a pressurized rock chamber. ROP, WOB, RPM, pressure, bit type and rock type can be varied. High-frequency measurement instrumentation, including new in-bit sensing, record the tangential accelerations and dynamic torque at various positions in the laboratory rig. The type of excited torsional vibrations match vibrations in the field indicating that learnings in the lab translate to the field. To study the influence of bit and operating parameters on HFTO, PDC-bits of varying design are used to drill rocks under varying pressures, RPMs and WOB. The data are used to develop evaluation methods to rank bit-rock combinations with regards to the stability and severity of the generated vibrations.  Stability maps relating RPM, WOB, and vibration proved to be a good measure to reliably identify HFTO and rank bit-rock combinations and applied operating parameters, by their susceptibility to HFTO. Bit properties, such as cutter shape, cutter placement or rock type control the energy intake per vibration cycle and, hence, the excitation of torsional vibrations. The operating parameter space indicating stable drilling states can be maximized by properly choosing bit features. Rock types triggering HFTO are identified using segmented core tests. When HFTO is present and fully developed, the severity of vibrations scales with the angular velocity of the bit (RPM) but not with the WOB. If HFTO is absent, WOB and RPM act as an "on-off" switch to HFTO. The threshold of WOB and RPM triggering HFTO is established for bit-rock combinations. The stable operating zone can be influenced by adding damping devices to the BHA. The findings also result in recommendations for operating BHAs in the field.  Studying HFTO in a full-scale laboratory environment using the presented methods enables the development of robust and reliable HFTO countermeasures. Major influences on HFTO are identified and scientifically proven; understanding these characteristics will result in HFTO suppressing bits and tools. Ultimately, HFTO mitigation allows drilling engineers to optimize drilling parameters and reduce drilling time while simultaneously decreasing tool-failure probability and associated NPT and costs.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry pushes for longer, faster, and more reliable well construction. Predicting and optimizing drill bit performance offers tremendous potential to achieve high rate-of-penetrations. Torsional and lateral vibrations are detrimental to bits and drilling tools. Specifically, High-Frequency Torsional Oscillations (HFTO) can lead to electronic failures, body cracks and twist-offs of drilling tools. A recently upgraded full-scale drilling rig enables the analysis of drilling speed and generated high frequency vibrations under laboratory conditions. This paper presents new methods to optimize bit performance and stability fast, at low costs and low risks for performance and stability in a controlled environment. The results are validated by field operations in North America Land.  Four bit designs were used to drill rocks under realistic downhole pressure and WOB and RPMs in the lab. High-frequency sensors at the rig and in the bit capture the rate-of-penetration and the dynamic response at multiple combinations of operative parameters. The data allow a full assessment of the performance, efficiency and lateral and torsional stability of bits using stability-maps, Rate of Penetration (ROP)-maps, MSE maps and Depth-of-Cut (DOC)-WOB curves. The lab tests are supported by 3D full bit simulations. The lab results are compared to field operations in vibration prone rocks in North America. The field runs were drilled in comparable well paths, formations and BHAs enabling a direct comparison. The bottom-hole-assemblies (BHA) were simulated and compared to high-frequency downhole data, surface data and offset-wells. Recommendations for choice and operation of the drill bits are deduced to reduce loads on the BHA while increasing drilling performance.  The best bit design showed a 33\\% higher ROP while increasing the torsional stability. Stability maps revealed stable regions of RPM-WOB combinations free of torsional vibrations. HFTO can be mitigated by increasing the rotational speed above an RPM threshold. The range of HFTO free operative parameters was enlarged by 40\\% through bit design optimization. The best bit design also showed superior performance in the field achieving instantaneous ROP of more than 1,000 ft/h. Multiple record runs have been achieved with this frame including the most recent of drilling greater than 12,000 ft in a 24-hour period and drilling more than 25,000 feet in a single run.  The new bit optimization methods enable to improve bit designs, develop operational recommendations quicker, minimize costs, and deliver more precise and reliable solutions compared to optimizations in field operations. Improvements of the performance and the torsional stability simultaneously are made possible through the upgraded drilling rig. The suppression of HFTO by bit design and cutter configuration combined with expanded stable operating parameters will lead to increased tool reliability, less NPT and higher drilling performance.}

	abstract		= {Drilling automation and remote operations are driving advisory systems to provide a safe operating environment, protect the wellbore, and optimize efficiency at the wellsite. These interoperable systems deliver guidance to control systems, for example set points and limits for drilling parameters. The Drilling and Wells Interoperability Standard Industry Group (D-WIS) under the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) wants to accelerate interoperable system implementation by outlining a compelling value case.  The adoption of drilling operation automation systems is increasing operational efficiency and opening new opportunities to manage drilling with advisory systems. These systems are the focus of efforts in interoperability (i.e., plug-and-play functionality) to remove data communication obstacles and allow the implementation of the next generation of advisory and process control technology. This paper describes the technology focus, status, and impact of the current industry efforts and organizations contributing to interoperable systems regarding the core system components and standardization needs. The value case is made for an interoperability standard suitable for large scale industry deployment.  The current industry state reveals custom-made supplier solutions continuing to expand and evolve with limited applicability due to a bespoke approach. The authors observe and contrast this method with an interoperable system approach to make the value case in terms of easier and faster implementation and scalability, better reliability and access to data, and lower development and operations cost, resulting in a higher overall value. A comparison of the two competing scenarios along with past industry efforts toward standardization clarifies how to best realize the vision of safely and efficiently sharing information and facilitating drilling operations. Collaborative efforts between industry organizations also help address areas of overlap and gaps related to interoperability and creation of a standard. The conclusions outline the minimum requirements of a focused industry effort to deliver an implementation-ready system. System adoption is accelerated by creating deliverables fit for roadmaps and specific collaboration points.  The paper examines the effectiveness of current interoperable system efforts. It describes and demonstrates industry influencing work towards interoperable drilling systems and builds on a collection of industry work beyond Sadlier and Laing 2011, and Macpherson et al. 2013.}

They enable the surface MPD system to be integrated with the riser, allowing for safe and fast installation and retrieval despite complexities.  Deepwater MPD integrated riser joints are made up of (a) a below-tension-ring rotating control device (BTR-RCD) to create a seal around the drill string during the drilling and tripping process. (b) an MPD annular packer that serves as an alternative sealing device when the rotating control device (RCD) or active control device (ACD) is not deployed or needs maintenance (c) a flow spool featuring valves and tie-in points for hoses facilitating the circulation of drilling fluids from downhole to surface equipment. (d) Choke, kill and boost line conduit to interface with the rigs riser joints. The instrumentation system installed on the IRJ enables real-time wellbore pressure monitoring and remote control of MPD flow line valves. The choke, kill boost conduits as well as mux line clamp locations facilitate a normal riser set up for surface to subsea blowout preventer (BOP) communications.  IRJs that are deployed for deepwater MPD installations represent a significant advancement over the systems used in early floating rig MPD operations. They are designed for efficient and safe deployment and are compatible with a variety of deepwater drilling systems. MPD integrated riser joints operate in a complex wellbore condition allowing efficient and effective wellbore pressure control, improving the safety of deepwater drilling operations. It enables real-time monitoring of the wellbore parameters allowing drilling supervisors and engineers to make timely adjustments to drilling parameters. This technical paper reviews key design considerations of different IRJ systems developed by the industry and used in deepwater MPD operations. The paper examines how the IRJ system has evolved over time due to the requirement for a more efficient method of deploying RCD and annular isolation devices in deepwater wells.

A key objective of this SIT was to verify and de-risk tools and techniques prior to their potential deployment in an offshore target well.  A deepwater well, located offshore Brazil, was used as the basis for the design of the SIT program. The objective of the well operation was to permanently isolate the production tubing and the A-annulus in which a flatpack containing 2x chemical injection lines and 1x electrical line is present. To ensure the flatpack would not provide a leakage pathway it had to be cut into pieces prior to cementing the A-annulus.  A completion string mimicking the main features of the well was designed utilizing 10 \textthreequarters{}in. casing, 6-5/8in. tubing with a flatpack and a restriction created by the downhole safety valve (DHSV). The completion was installed inside a large diameter test well and thereafter the technologies to be verified were deployed using wireline and rigless coiled tubing interventions.  After installation of the test well completion, the performance of various technologies was investigated through the following operations: \begin{bulletedlist}\item Flatpack detection with four different e-line ultrasonic \& electro-magnetic tools \item Flatpack ablation with custom designed oriented shaped charges utilizing two different gun designs run on wireline\item Through tubing cement placement utilizing a Perf, Wash \& Cement technique deployed on coiled tubing\item Coiled tubing cement mill out using a motor, bit and underreamer able to pass the DHSV and remove the cement plug from the tubing\item Evaluation of the annular barrier quality using a cement bond logging tool\item Recovery of the well completion, keeping the A-annulus barrier intact for subsequent inspection at surface and comparison to the log results \end{bulletedlist} The performance of state-of-the-art technologies that can enable rig-less through-tubing plug and abandonment (P\&A) utilizing wireline and coiled tubing interventions have been investigated and de-risked through an SIT executed in a test well completion mimicking an actual offshore deepwater well.}

	abstract		= {The fastline is the part of the drilling line running between the drawworks drum and first sheave of the crown block assembly. Lateral vibrations of the fastline can be severe, have a negative effect on wear rates, and can cause damage to equipment with subsequential downtime. In the worst cases, severe vibrations can cause injury or even be fatal to personal. The goal of this paper is to show how a simulation model can help to identify risk factors and remedies to minimize the likelihood of spooling errors and other hazards.  This paper presents the results from an advanced simulation model describing both the generation and decay of fastline vibrations. The model includes a dynamic drawworks model having many features, such as a multilayer Lebus drum spooling, line elasticity, sheave and line inertia, and realistic speed control response of the drawworks motors. The simulation results strongly indicate that a dominating high-risk factor for error spooling is a low fastline tension force resulting from a combination of a low hook load and dynamic effects, like a high fastline speed and a rapid speed ramp-down (high deceleration rate). Other risk factors include poor damping of the generated fastline vibrations and high fastline inclination (deviation from vertical). Even though inherent bending resistance of the wire rope is a significant damping mechanism for high-frequency vibrations, it is very weak for low-frequency vibrations generated by tension variations or by axial deflection speed reversal at layer shifts. The improved model also shows that a conventional stabilizer dampens fastline vibrations poorly. In contrast, a new type of the stabilizer, which is placed closer to the fast sheave and uses passive but tuned dampeners, shows promise. Even though it is placed at a further distance from the drum, simulations strongly indicate that it can effectively dampen low frequency fastline vibrations and thereby decrease the risk of hazards.}

	abstract		= {The poor performance of PDC bits in harder formations is caused by downhole vibrations. However, proper operating conditions (i.e.\ low rotary speed and high weight on bit) and new technology for vibration control (anti-whirl PDC bits and a soft-torque rotary system) can successfully extend the application of PDC bits to harder formations. This conclusion is based on numerical modelling of PDC bit/drillstring assemblies and is supported by recent developments in PDC bit technology and torsional vibration control systems. The PDC bit model is fully dynamic and three-dimensional and is used to simulate normal rotary drilling. Sensitivity analyses of different PDC bit designs show bit-induced torsional, axial and lateral vibrations. Moreover, these analyses show that conventional PDC bits tend to whirl backward, resulting in reduced penetration rates and bit life. Anti-whirl PDC bits effectively reduce this tendency when run under the proper operating conditions of low rotary speed and high weight on bit.  Downhole measurements and numerical analyses clearly demonstrate that, during normal rotary drilling, the drillstring vibrates in several modes of vibration. Downhole vibrations frequently result in inconsistent bit performance, drillstring failure, problems with directional control, lack of measurement while drilling (MWD) signal detection and borehole instability. In particular in harder formations severe vibrations cause particular in harder formations severe vibrations cause premature polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit premature polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit failure. This has led to the generally accepted field practice that PDC bits are run mainly in soft to practice that PDC bits are run mainly in soft to medium-hard formations. This is rather disappointing, considering artificial diamond cutters can cut very hard rock under controlled conditions. The work presented in this paper was initiated to investigate the presented in this paper was initiated to investigate the effects of PDC-bit-induced vibrations and to address the problems associated with drilling harder formations.  For a better understanding of the complex phenomena experienced during drilling, numerical phenomena experienced during drilling, numerical simulation of the drillstring behaviour is essential. In general, the computer programs for drillstring dynamics reported in literature deal with boundary conditions at the bit only or use a simple bit model. The drilling motion of the bit, including formation removal, is not taken into account. On the other hand, dedicated PDC bit models are kinematic, i.e. the bit motion is prescribed, and two-dimensional, and therefore cannot be used for the investigation of the dynamic behaviour of PDC bits. Recently a three-dimensional PDC bit model was presented by Behr et al. Again it is a kinematic presented by Behr et al. Again it is a kinematic model, although it is possible to compute the cutting forces for more complex bit motions like bit whirl. Brett uses an experimentally derived PDC bit model and a simple mass-spring model of the torsional drillstring motion.},

	abstract		= {In today's ever-changing and competitive environment, oil and gas industry is quickly moving towards integrated technologies as a founding pillar of any business strategy able to meet the trilemma of the growing energy demand together with the need of an equitable supply and its environmental sustainability.  Deep water drilling technologies are universally recognized among the front runner along this road map, coming from a long journey of trials and errors and capable only in the recent years to move close to the full potential made by the integration, completely machine controlled, of multiple rig equipment.  This paper describes one among the first experience made in the industry of such process control automation set up on the 7th generation drilling ship Saipem Santorini in Gulf of Mexico over the years 2022 and 2023.  Results achieved clearly demonstrate a tangible enhancement of the work safety, as the human/machine interface is lowered by near the 50\% along the whole well construction process, as well as the drilling and completion performance went beyond the 10\% of global well time reduction, just as a starting point.  This first experience has been documented over a collaborative one-year period through advanced KPI monitoring and systematic approach used for installation, training, remote support and data analytics that illustrates a proven path to success which is going to be reiterated soon up to a level of a new standard for deep water drilling.}

But is whirl still the major cause of PDC bit damage in today's applications? This paper reports on a recent field study in which downhole vibrations were measured using a newly available in-bit vibration-monitoring device. The focus of this study was to understand today's North American vertical conventional rotary applications. In addition, four wells were also drilled using a research drill rig in Oklahoma. In these tests, PDC bits, BHAs, and operating parameters were varied to document their effect on downhole vibrations. In these four wells, vibration measurements from the new in-bit measuring device were validated against a commercially available and industry-proven MWD vibration monitoring service. Also, a computer model that accounts for the coupled response of bits and BHAs was run for selected tests in field wells and the research drilling rig. The models agreed well with the measured cases in both whirl and stick-slip. The model also allowed the authors to confirm that high-frequency torsional oscillations (4-9 Hz) which we observed were, as a previous industry paper suggests, due to BHA torsional resonance.  The results of this study indicate that the most common field vibration today in hard rock PDC drilling is stick-slip, not whirl, in the target test region. In field tests, stick-slip was almost exclusively observed. For typical field applications with a surface rotary speed of about 70, we have measured peak downhole RPM during the slip phase as high as 500. This paper will report on these findings, document damage resulting from stick-slip, and suggest potential solutions to mitigate downhole vibrations.},

In this paper, data acquisition tools with high-frequency sample rates and the data processing are introduced. Based on high-frequency data, progress of drilling dynamics is summarized, including new understandings of low-frequency drillstring dynamics, high-frequency torsional oscillations (HFTOs), and high-frequency axial oscillations (HFAOs) and new findings for the coupling of vibrations and motions, as well as models and simulation methods to deeply comprehend high-frequency dynamics of drillstring. High-frequency measurements have been used for enabling drillers to improve drill performance, especially for field decision making, BHA selection, and bit design, usually through the ways of minimizing vibrations to obtain high-efficient drilling conditions, the high-frequency response near bit can also be used for lithology identification during drilling. Though there still exists a gap between research perspective and drilling practice, the industry of high-frequency measurements has gotten off a good start, which has huge potential to avoid nonproductive time thereupon reducing drilling cost in the future.},

It is difficult to control lateral vibration amplitude and impact intensity even with advanced measurement apparatus. So it is feasible to use a theoretic method to analyze and predict lateral vibration in order to adjust drilling parameters in realtime. On the basis of beam-column series and spring-concentrated mass model, a new analytical model is established to realize the control of lateral vibration and impact.  The severe lateral vibration and impact of drill string will not only cause the fatigue and fracture of drill string [1\textendash{}2], but also broaden hole and change side force and bending angle of bit which lead to damage quality of a directional well [3]. But it is difficult to control lateral vibration amplitude and impact intensity because the phenomenon of lateral vibration and impact of drill string can not be observed at surface without the expensive MWD (measurement while drilling) apparatus [4\textendash{}5]. In order to improve the control and prediction method of lateral vibration comparatively, this paper tries to attest the feasibility to use a theoretic method to analyze and predict lateral vibration and impact. The present drill string dynamic methods mainly use finite element method [6\textendash{}7] which needs too complex calculation to be used in drilling field. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a simple analytical model of lateral vibration and impact to design and adjust drilling parameters in real-time. On the basis of beam-column series and spring-concentrated mass model, a new analytical model is established which consider many factors, such as: BHA (bottom-hole assemble), WOB (weight on bit) fluctuation, ROB (rotation of bit).},

Experiments of Taylor bubble countercurrent behavior in an eccentric 6 in.\ \texttimes{} 4 in.\ annulus were conducted. Fluid rheology, annulus inclination, and internal pipe rotational speed were varied to provide a clearer understanding of Taylor bubble physics under non-Newtonian countercurrent flow and its implications for effectively managing upward gas migration that can occur in a wellbore during drilling operations in fractured or vugular rock formations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to estimate the velocity of Taylor bubble in vertical annuli with downward fluid flow and a new closure relation for distribution parameter, $C_0$, was proposed. The drift flux model embedded in the new gas migration velocity model was applied to simulate the dynamics of bullheading/PMCD. Good agreement between the model and published data was obtained. The effect of different bullheading rates on surface pressure and gas fraction in PMCD operation was examined.}

	abstract		= {Addressing gas migration in a static mud column during the shut-in period is a major concern in Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling (PMCD). Significant discrepancies have been found between the field data and existing correlations for gas migration velocity, since the latter are based on either small-scale experiments or overly simplified assumptions, resulting in overly conservative estimations. To meet the Light Annular Mud (LAM) requirement for managing gas migration and to monitor the transient pressure experienced throughout the PMCD operation, an improved gas migration velocity model was developed by combining the equation of motion (bubble flow) and Taylor-bubble correlation (slug flow). In the bubble flow model, the effects of non-Newtonian fluid properties and drill pipe rotation are considered through a modified drag coefficient ($C_D$) that incorporates the bubble Reynolds number ($Re_b$) and dimensionless shear rate ($Sr$). The effect of bubble swarm is taken into account through a void fraction ($\alpha_g$) term. The slug flow model is based on a Taylor bubble correlation in terms of E\"{o}tv\"{o}s number ($Eo$) and inverse viscosity number ($Nf$). For the first time, the dependence of Taylor bubble velocity on drill pipe rotation has been shown and correlated as a function of $Sr$. Predictions of the gas migration velocities in PMCD operations are made and successfully compared with the existing models and test-well experimental data. The drift flux model embedded in the new gas migration velocity model was applied to simulate the gas migration in a test well. Good agreement between the model and measured pressure results in the full-scale test-well experiments can be obtained. Its companion work (Liu et al., 2023) provides the design and calculation method of key parameters in bullheading/PMCD operations}

	abstract		= {Simulation of drilling processes involves the seamless integration of strongly coupled physics, numeric, and economic models. Operators desire advanced drilling simulation software that can mimic reality and yet be practical for daily operations. At the same time, academic researchers are devoting time and effort to develop robust and accurate models of every module of an integrated drilling environment but are challenged with translating their original contributions into the operational setting. We seek to solve both of these issues through a distinctive collaboration consortium based on an open-source paradigm. We describe and propose an advanced drilling simulation developed through a joint industry consortium at Texas A\&M University. The simulator provides free access to sophisticated and reliable drilling dynamics solvers. This includes drill string dynamics, torque and drag analysis, geologic modeling, hydraulics, and wellbore pressure modeling, visualization, and operator interfaces. The simulator is written in C++ and is built on top of high-performance open source libraries that leverages parallel computing, GPU acceleration, multibody, and computational fluid dynamics solvers as well as other tools (see figure for further details). We will assist industry and academic users to employ our open-source tool. In addition, we will help said parties further develop our framework into proprietary and protected business software via the addition of custom functionality. The simulator core was successfully developed and has been used to model horizontal drilling, while providing near real-time performance. The framework has been used in several applications successfully, including modeling shallow horizontal jetting, rock drilling, and steering; as well as reconstructing spatial data from high fidelity downhole signals for borehole evaluation, and the development of improved downhole navigation algorithms. We believe that a collaborative development effort between academia and industry will bring solutions to complex modeling needs faster and more economically than any individual endeavor. To this end, the authors will also show how one can partner with Texas A\&M University to obtain access to the open-source enabled drilling simulation framework and platform to collaborate, improve and create solutions for new and existing problems.}

	abstract		= {The main objective in this work was to develop and test automated pore pressure and wellbore stability predictions ahead of bit using a digital twin. The new automated real-time workflow, with three smart agents for pore pressure, mudweight and well pressure was tested on historical data and real-time drilling campaigns for one exploration well and several production wells in the North Sea and offshore Mid-Norway. A digital workflow is set up from pre-drill 3D basin scale pore pressure modelling using a stochastic Monte-Carlo approach, including an automated update of pressure prognosis while drilling using sonic or resistivity data. Additionally, the innovative approach will also reduce the uncertainty in the predicted mud-weight window ahead of the bit. Three new smart agents have been implemented in a real-time data platform for drilling; one for pore pressure prediction, one for mudweight real-time calculations and one for well pressure real-time predictions.  The new automated workflow has been tested on several wells, either in real-time, or on historical data as playback. Both pressure real-time updates using sonic log (for exploration well) and resistivity data (for production well) have been tested with very good results, especially when filters on the raw log data are used, removing artefacts in input data, effect of well inclinations, lithologies etc. In addition, the real-time Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) prediction has been compared with downhole ECD measurements. Digital twin using playback data from a well, offshore Mid-Norway has been carried out with automated correction and smoothing of the calculated pore pressure from resistivity log. The new automated workflow will contribute to increase the efficiency of drilling operations subject to narrow pressure margins and uncertain reservoir pressure, by providing a quantitative and adaptive automated workflow to support the drillers/rig crews.  The new automated workflow is presented for both exploration and production wells and the workflow can contribute to more cost effective and safer operations. The methodology can in the future be combined with machine learning.}

	abstract		= {Drilling geothermal and HPHT wells is complicated by exposure of downhole tools to high temperatures. Pro-active downhole temperature management is therefore very important to prevent heat-related tool failure which can result in significant non-productive time and increased costs. Temperature management that relies heavily on surface cooling is currently mostly a manual process. This paper presents a control-oriented platform to achieve automated managed temperature drilling in real-time. For the controller, an improved reduced drift-flux model that considers temperature dynamics, interface mass transfer, and a new lumped pressure dynamics model is used. By considering these factors, the model is used to digitally twin the transient thermal behavior of geothermal wells. The improved temperature model is validated using experimental results from the Utah FORGE 16A(78)-32 dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the model, it is used in conjunction with a controller to simulate maintaining a sufficiently cool bottom-hole temperature for downhole tools in various drilling scenarios. These thermal control scenarios demonstrate that the model can be used for control design, which effectively controls the downhole temperatures during the well construction process. This paper presents the first control-oriented platform that automatically manages the downhole temperature in a geothermal or HPHT well. By using a model capable of real-time simulation, automatic and predictive control algorithms can be applied to reduce negative thermal effects during drilling, thereby significantly decreasing non-productive time events and the cost of constructing a geothermal well.}

	abstract		= {Many models in the industry use the notion of an effective length to make predictions about the bottom hole assembly (BHA), whether for its directional behavior or its lateral vibration tendency. A given criteria is chosen to cut the drill string at a certain distance from the bit and use only that part for the computations. In this paper, this cutting distance is referred to as the effective length. Though computationally efficient, and thus providing fast real-time predictions, there is no consensus on what criteria should be chosen, nor a ``bulletproof recipe'' on how to compute that length. Miscalculating this effective length, especially for vibration mitigation purposes, can lead to suboptimal rotation speed selection, potentially causing failure.  To address this challenge, different choices of effective length computations are compared in terms of BHA yield rate prediction (build/drop and turn rate). Past a given distance from the bit, the computed side force and tilt at the bit are nearly identical, meaning that any element very far from the bit is negligible in the static calculation. However, studying lateral vibrations is more complex especially at low inclinations or in horizontal wells with high weight on bit (WOB) where the drill string can move more freely with snaking and whirling motions. A nonlinear time-domain model is utilized to evaluate the propagation of lateral vibrations up the string. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted on several BHA types and lengths, considering different boundary conditions in vertical and horizontal wells.  Directional models are found to be reasonably unsensitive to the choice of the effective length because they are based on steady-state computations, but the same cannot be stated for dynamics. This study developed a more robust approach to estimate properly the effective length for lateral vibrations, an essential for BHA resonance. The theoretical predictions of critical speeds were compared to time-domain simulations, which take into account the nonlinearities related to contact and friction forces. Spectral analysis of the results helped identify the main sources of vibration, whether it comes from BHA mass imbalance, drill string-wellbore interactions, or other sources. This combination between frequency- and time-based analyses is used to validate our choice of the effective length.  Many models, from steady state to dynamics with both frequency and time domain analysis, are used to approach the effective length problem from various perspectives. This study aims to compensate the lack of in-depth analysis on this important subject. It shows the importance to understand the strengths and limits of frequency-based models compared to the more complex time-domain modeling.}

	abstract		= {Downhole drilling dynamic data has proven to be valuable operational information for vibration mitigation and drilling optimization. Yet, the downhole dynamic behavior of the BHA is often misinterpreted. Most downscaled experimental investigations neglect the changes in dynamic field conditions due to fluid flow. The objective of this work is to establish a visual understanding of downhole vibration data analysis in the presence of fully circulated fluid flow and to investigate the effect of flow rate on the BHA lateral trajectory, using a scaled laboratory BHA. A mechanically downscaled test assembly adhering to the geometric and material property relations of a field-size BHA section was designed and manufactured to investigate the nature of lateral vibration under field-like fluid flow conditions. Axial excitation and rotation were induced respectively using an electromagnetic shaker and an electrical motor. Fluid was pumped through the BHA using an electric pump and an in-house designed swivel. The BHA trajectory was mapped using inductive displacement sensors mounted outside the transparent wellbore structure for direct visual correlation between the BHA movement and the vibration data. Real-time induced bit vibration was observed and recorded using a high-frequency tri-axial accelerometer. The results from this experiment provide precise and insightful visual information for BHA trajectory correlation with the acceleration data acquired under field-like fluid flow conditions. The BHA vibration behavior of high-frequency accelerations (shock and vibration), critical lateral vibration phenomena such as whirling, and shift in dominant vibration frequencies were characterized based on both the nature of dynamic forces at the bit and fluid flow rates. Instead of a general observation of the vibration-damping effect in the presence of circulating fluid, the experiment also presents correlations between vibration characteristic changes at different frequencies for different flow rates. In conclusion, the investigation distinguishes between the dynamic relation of fluid damping of vibration and fluid-induced vibrations, both in relation to the dynamic vibration data and the downhole dynamic behavior of BHA movement. The novel experiment establishes both quantitative and qualitative relations between the observation of acceleration data and physical vibration behavior during drilling in the presence of circulating fluid. The experimental results provide clear insight not only into the dynamic nature of vibration-damping but also into fluid-induced vibrations, which affect the window of safe operating drilling conditions.}

This paper aims to demonstrate how drilling parameter optimisation in real-time provides a drilling team with an Edge based solution that can continuously improve performance and avoid problems without the need of subject matter experts. Results from testing the Edge-System on multiple wells from several operators are presented related to auto-calibration of real-time prediction models and for optimization of drilling parameters. This system based on cloud technology with Model based reasoning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is able to give real-time and forward advice for operational parameters, ref SPE-204074-MSThe key enabler for such system is "automatic" auto-calibration of models which is used for multiple forward-looking and what-if calculations to find optimal drilling parameters within the well envelope ahead.  A simplified configuration has been made so that the rig-team can operate and maintain the system without the need for subject matter experts. "Automatic" Auto-calibration at stable conditions and/or during ramping conditions removes the need for subject matter experts. Such a system helps reduce operational costs as the rig-team can operate the system without the need of back-office support. Comparison will be made to document operational improvements.}

	abstract		= {An operator in Colombia applied a splitter well arrangement for the first time to provide an optimal directional drilling design and execution strategy based on cutting edge surveying technology, data analytics, and a calibrated magnetic scan model. The drilling faced the challenges of potential well collision scenarios with pressure risk. Knowledge-sharing from the operation offers a benchmark for magnetic scan and trajectory design methodologies to aid in addressing complexities associated with directional drilling.  For the first time, the operator implemented gyro-while-drilling (GWD) technology with a solid-state sensor, specifically for surface sections. Optimal intervals for GWD and MWD runs were identified through a calibrated magnetic scan model. Data analytics and visualizations supported a safer design and execution of nine complex horizontal wells in a splitter well arrangement. This approach facilitated the continuous capture and application of lessons learned, enhancing the operator's well-by-well strategy. Pressure and collision risk challenges were effectively managed using a comprehensive exemption process and a robust prevention and mitigation plan.  Results from drilling in sequence from surface to production (not in batch), nine splitter wells have shown zero health, safety, and environment events, zero well collision events, successful wellbore departure with the inertial toolface of GWD, and effective directional control with geological targets achieved while preserving a safe separation distance between the splitter wells without need of trajectory replanning or increase of drilling risks. The GWD sensor was the primary surveying tool for the surface section in a 12 ¼-in. hole size. Measurement-while-drilling tools transmitted real-time data to surface. The azimuth measurements proved enough accuracy to be used as reference after being compared to GWD, even in the presence of high external magnetic interference. These measurements provided a benchmark for a well arrangement at low separation distance at the well reference point and demonstrated an acceptable accuracy to use MWD measurement at magnetic scan separation starting from 15 ft for the casing design used in this campaign. The magnetic scan model was an effective method to define the GWD interval for the well. These nine wells resulted in 60\% land use reduction over conventional designs; the technical viability of the splitter well project is important for a more sustainable future of drilling operations in Colombia. This was the first use of the GWD solid state sensor in Colombia and the first splitter well arrangement for the operator. This case study from the Rubiales field leverages data to take right decisions and will provide practical guidance to engineers facing similar challenges in constrained drilling environments for sequential drilling.}

	abstract		= {The development and application of a fit for purpose CO2 Injection Model is presented in the context of a front-end engineering design for a new Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project targeting a depleted gas reservoir in the North Sea. The growing trend towards long-term industrial scale CCS presents challenges for the current industry design capabilities. In conjunction with the wider CCS system design, particular engineering design and integrity assurance requirements must be addressed for the wellbore components.  An appropriate Equation of State which accounts for impurities and multi-phase flow conditions is required to predict rapid changes in fluid behavior. With a depleted gas reservoir as the storage target, early-life versus late-life wellbore conditions can be significantly different. The tubular design workflow was finalized using a CO2 Injection Model deployed via a cloud-based software platform developed in concert with the well engineering design process in an agile manner. Validation of the model was provided by comparison with benchmarks from legacy software.  Coupled with drilling and cementing conditions from the well construction phase, the resultant thermal stresses on tubulars, connections and completion components during gaseous, dense and multi-phase CO2 well operating conditions need to be accurately predicted as they can be significant. Downhole conditions can be affected by cooling from adiabatic expansion and Joule-Thomson effects across chokes, due to wellbore friction and at the sand face. Transient operations during shut-in and restart result in low design case temperatures. Low-probability survival conditions under simulated blowout or leakage scenarios require to be modeled and can result in worst-case temperature qualification requirements for wellbore equipment.  Industry work groups have proposed the GERG-2008 Equation of State as a standard model for CCS operations and well design. However, potential limitations noted in technical literature appear evident from detailed well sensitivity analysis. Potential improvements to the GERG-2008 model as well as requirements for an improved fit for purpose Equation of State are outlined.}

	abstract		= {The Gulf of Mexico plays a pivotal role in the United States’ energy landscape, serving as the primary offshore source of oil and gas. It contributes approximately 97\% of all oil and gas production on the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Within this dynamic offshore environment, numerous major operators manage a variety of platforms and systems. Notably, a longstanding pioneer in the Gulf region has been at the forefront of technological advancements in the design, construction, and operation of world-class oil and gas production facilities for over four decades. The prominence of being one of the Gulf’s key operators comes with both advantages and challenges that must be addressed as part of the daily operational landscape. Historically, this operator has adhered to its established best practices and remained loyal to proven strategies, which can pose challenges when introducing new products or technologies.  In May 2021, a situation arose when a client contacted a multinational service company, seeking assistance with a well in the production phase located adjacent to the Mississippi Canyon. A case of Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP) emerged in the B-Annulus, necessitating a resolution within an extremely tight timeframe of just 2-3 weeks. In response to this critical situation, our organization was tasked with delivering a solution to remediate the well afflicted by SCP and hydrocarbon (HC) flow issues. Within our extensive technology portfolio, a Flexible Self-Healing Cement (FSHC) system was identified as the ideal solution to ensure well integrity from drilling through abandonment, providing a reliable annular pressure seal and safeguarding against hydrocarbon leaks and SCP at the wellhead. Tailored to meet the client’s unique challenges and specifications, this system was deemed the most suitable choice for the operation. This paper delves into the comprehensive development, execution, evaluation, and post-job analysis of the inaugural application of the Flexible Self-Healing Cement system in the Gulf of Mexico. This innovative system promises to address the pressing challenges posed by SCP and HC flow, further enhancing the operational efficiency and well integrity in this strategically vital region.}

	abstract		= {Wellbore intersections are typically achieved using a conventional rotary drilling rig and wireline deployed magnetic ranging tools. Separate trips are made for each system in order to intersect a target wellbore. While this approach is often successful, it is time-consuming, resulting in more time spent on tripping than drilling. The extended trip times and the potential for well control vulnerabilities are issues that require attention. This paper introduces a novel solution to address these concerns.  The primary objective is to expedite wellbore intersections while improving process safety. The field-tested solution presented here involves the implementation of a coiled tubing ranging while drilling system, integrating electric current injection and sensor assembly into a single BHA with a live data connection to the surface. By eliminating separate wireline runs and reducing jointed pipe trip times, operations are significantly accelerated while dramatically improving key performance metrics. A high density of ranging data sets, averaging 3,800 samples per minute, was maintained during drilling. This method offers an efficient and safe alternative by combining multiple independent services at the wellsite into an end-to-end solution. Furthermore, the technology provides additional safety barriers that are not feasible with conventional methods.  The commercial demonstration results describe the successful deployment of the novel system, potentially yielding up to five-fold efficiency improvement compared to legacy techniques widely accepted in the industry. This new approach enables a significant advancement in wellbore intercept techniques, paving the way for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and success in challenging wellbore environments.}

	abstract		= {Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) is used extensively in the drilling industry for numerous purposes, most commonly as a strategy for drilling optimization. Additionally, MSE is used for determination of rock hardness, development and assessment of drilling parameters roadmaps, benchmarking, and drilling efficiency calibrations. MSE, in addition to being used for identification and remediation of drilling dysfunctions, is also utilized in completions design optimization for unconventionals. These applications of MSE are important in all drilling operations, regardless of asset class, from exploration through development.  MSE deployment is grounded in several strongly held positions, with associated implications. In Part-1 (SPE 212508) of this critical conversation, which attracted intense industry debate, it was revealed that most MSE claims lack factual validations, and that the assertions had numerous fallacies and pitfalls. These findings, which established limitations and inefficiencies in MSE deployment, are critical for the industry. Most importantly, awareness of MSE shortfalls will ensure development of effective, and verifiable solutions for drilling efficiency improvement. MSE initiatives and claims must be held true, supported by operational objectives, and ratified by physics and drilling mechanics principles.  This follow-up paper identifies additional MSE deficits, with primary focus on its claims. These assertions, as will be discussed include the following \textendash{} performance benchmarking, drilling efficiency quantification and improvement, identification of performance risks and limiters, recognition, and remediation of drilling dysfunctions \textendash{} regardless of asset class and/or application type. Fallacies and pitfalls associated with these claims will be identified and analyzed, through appropriate physics-based processes, where the erroneous implications of these claims, will be identified and discussed. In addition to supporting these positions with appropriate field data, a new systematic ``Five-Step'' process (AIVReC) for discussing dysfunctions will be introduced. It is worth noting that this paper’s positions promote development of appropriate workflows for data analytics and drilling automation processes. These needs cannot be achieved with current MSE positions and claims, because of the numerous fallacies and pitfalls.}

There is a consolidated need directed to log data interpreters to answer questions related to the type of material present in the casing annuli of a given well. The objective of this work is to explore the possibility to provide a complementary answer to current general acoustic impedance and attenuation practice.  We reiterate that knowledge about the density of the annuli material can reduce the well barrier evaluation uncertainty. We are describing and exemplifying a rapid method to estimate the "pseudo \textendash{} density" of the material in the annuli at the time of data acquisition. We define "pseudo-density" as the ratio between estimated impedance (from ultrasonic pulse-echo) and annuli apparent velocities (from ultrasonic oblique incidence techniques). Resulting "pseudo-density" maps are constrained with prior information from geology, logging, and drilling data. This allows the interpreter to judge the uncertainty in the current interpretation practice and contextualization of the annuli material into the borehole reality.  The examples provided show that when the underlying physics principles are met, the results are clear and a robust interpretation at scale along the entire logged path is possible. The estimated complementary results are affected by inherent errors and uncertainty associated with acoustic impedance and velocity estimation. However, using prior knowledge information, intervals with high uncertainty (such as unusually high impedances or large errors in the velocity estimation) are flagged providing the interpreter with information background easy to be used for final delivery.  Along with standard applications, the proposed method includes the basic mandatory tool for evaluating, validating, and incorporating the forecasted growth based on nuclear integrity logging behind the casing evaluation techniques.}

	abstract		= {Reaming while drilling (RWD) in general means to simultaneously drill a pilot hole and open it up to the target diameter at the same time. This could be done using an eccentric reaming device or an expandable concentric underreamer; both are called reamer in the following. In RWD assemblies the weight applied to the BHA is distributed between the bit and reamer. To ensure optimized performance drilling, it’s necessary to know the distribution of weight as well as the distribution of torque in the BHA. For any calculation of drill string dynamics or tool durability the loads applied to the BHA are an essential input. The effort required to measure all loads while reaming is rather high so there is a need to calculate the weight and torque distribution from as few measurements as possible. Based on aggressiveness and mechanical specific energy (MSE), an analytical method is shown to calculate the load distribution in RWD BHAs. Therefore a new approach to aggressiveness is introduced for calculation at the bit and reamer. By combination of aggressiveness and MSE, it can be shown how to derive weight and torque distributions in a RWD BHA. Effects of formation changes or different drilling diameters on the rate of penetration (ROP) can be calculated, as well as changes in the load distribution. To prevent the reamer from disruptive weight and torque, depth of cut control (DOCC) technology can be applied at the bit as described by Thomson (2008). How this technology affects the reamer, even if only applied at the bit will be shown as well. Based on data from a field test where weight and torque on bit and on reamer were measured simultaneously the accuracy/validity of the method is shown.}

	abstract		= {In a hole-opening application, cutting forces are applied to the drillstring simultaneously at the bit and the underreamer. Cutting forces at the reamer are known widely in the industry to cause additional vibrations of the drillstring that could harm the bottomhole assembly (BHA). This causes unnecessary downtime at the rigsite and increases costs. Expandable underreamers have very limited design envelopes for the optimization of their cutter layout. Most have only three blades and high-profile angles. Common polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits have five or more blades and generate most of the cutting forces at their inner cutters. Reamers, due to their resulting forces, have significantly different characteristics compared to bits. By using appropriate bit-dynamics simulation software it is possible to explain the reasons for these different bit and reamer characteristics. An in-depth study of the cutting forces enables a better understanding of the mechanics of vibration excitation, especially for underreamers.  Dynamic cutting force models for bits and reamers have been developed based on the results of cutting force analyses. These models contain weight, torque, and residual side force. They were implemented into a highly sophisticated drillstring model using finite-element analysis. Dynamics simulations in time domain of complete drillstrings resulting from the cutting forces at the bit and reamer are shown. Interactions of the pilot bit and reamer coupled by the BHA are also investigated using this model.  A field test was conducted using a hydraulically expandable underreamer. During this test, simultaneous dynamics measurements where taken at the bit and reamer in vertical and directional well sections. The measurements validate the simulation results.}

	abstract		= {Poor hole cleaning is often the cause for drilling performance deterioration, many times leading to detrimental situations such as pack-offs and stuck pipe.  In addition to high flowrate and rotational speed, lateral oscillations of the drill-string on the low-side of inclined wells were shown to improve hole cleaning. However, the drill-string lateral oscillations are usually not controlled in any way. This paper proposes a solution to trigger the lateral movement of the drill-string at certain positions, with simulation results to support the novel concept.  Generally, it is desirable to damp out drill-string vibrations as they impact drilling performance, can cause severe damage to drill-string/bottom hole assembly components, or destabilize the formation rocks. A solution based on distributed damping subs along the drill-string has been proposed to eliminate stick-slip and other forms of torsional vibrations. These damping subs utilize magnetic viscous damping through eddy current braking and their design enables active control of the damping strength. The latter fact allows to consider a coordinated control of the damping strength to initiate a controlled low amplitude lateral movement of the drill-string that can facilitate hole-cleaning while simultaneously attenuating torsional oscillations of the drill-string.  A simulated environment was used for verifying the proposed solution. It includes a transient stiff-string torque and drag model which accounts for axial, torsional and lateral displacements. The viscous damping subs are included in the model at defined locations along the drill-string. Several distributed control strategies have been simulated and the induced lateral movement of the drill-string has been analyzed. Simulations were performed with a well configuration from a field case. The first series of simulated experiments were focused on controlling the amount of viscous damping for all subs simultaneously with the same magnitude. It was observed that the effect on the lateral movement in this case was minor. In a second approach, subs placed at different locations had different damping strengths that were varied at specific time steps. Controlling the damping in a distributed fashion had a stronger effect on the local lateral movement and it was possible to create different localized movement patterns along the drill-string.  The concept of utilizing distributed damping subs along the drill-string opens the possibility to actively control the local lateral movement of the drill-pipes and therefore enhance hole cleaning performance. At the same time, torsional oscillations are damped out. Furthermore, the damping subs reduce the overall required torque at the top-drive and facilitate weight transmission to the bit.}

	abstract		= {The wellbore friction, torque and drag, between drill string and the wellbore wall is one of the most critical issues which limits the drilling industry to go beyond a certain measured depth. For this reason many studies on torque \& drag modeling have been performed. In this regard different approaches have been used; the difference in these approaches is often on how to include bending stiffness and shearing forces in the T\&D calculations. These approaches are (1) the effect of shear forces calculations with the assumption of continuous contact of the wellbore wall and the drillstring as well as constant curvature trajectory, (2) the effect of bending stiffness and shearing forces calculations with assuming of clearance between drillstring and wellbore-wall and (3) the effect of bending moment and shearing forces, assuming continuous contact of the pipe and wellbore-wall and using a non-constant curvature trajectory in which the first and second derivatives of the curve exist (i.e. spline type trajectories).  This paper consists of two main parts: first a review on literatures on the subject of stiff-string T\&D will be considered. Secondly, an approach will be discussed in which despite of the assumption of constant curvature trajectory and full-contact of pipe and wellbore wall, the effect of bending stiffness on torque and drag calculations are considered. The simple and robust stiff-string model is implemented in two example wells in order to find out the importance of the stiff-string calculations.}

	abstract		= {It is well accepted that torque and drag calculations are essential for well construction applications. To the authors' knowledge, the calculations are performed based on the concepts of the soft string model. This approach enables the wellbore designer to determine torque and other forces in the drillstring. While several modifications of the soft string model have been proposed and implemented in commercial software, the model mainly used in the oil and gas drilling industry is the static soft string model. As such, not only the string bending stiffness is neglected, but also it is assumed that the string is motionless and the direction of motion changes by merely changing the sign of friction coefficient. Clearly, there is a strong need for including acceleration effects in the soft string model to permit analysis of tripping operations and more accurate evaluation of the drillstring loading and consequently, the rig equipment (hoisting system, etc.).  In this paper, an improved dynamic soft string model is proposed that accounts for drillstring motion in 2D and 3D wellbores. This mathematical model explains how to compute forces along a moving drillstring or casing. The aims of this model are: 1) to analyze dynamic drillstring behavior, 2) to estimate local contact forces, and 3) to predict the effect of different tripping velocity profiles on axial and lateral contact forces. A system of equations for drillstring translational motion is solved using numerical methods. A computer code has been developed for practical design calculations.  The improved dynamic soft string model can be used to determine surface load and contact force as functions of time and measured depth. This model is also applied to predict surface load and contact forces in tripping operations. In particular, the model is implemented for drillpipe in two different 2D wellbores: horizontal and S-shaped, and a 3D wellbore while tripping in and out of the hole. As expected, the surface load vs. time plot shows a similar trend of tripping accelerations. Depending on the well path shape, drillstring properties, tripping acceleration, and velocity profile, the maximum dynamic loads can be in the range of 4-40\% higher compared to the conventional soft string model. In addition, results for two different tripping velocity profiles (trapezoidal and parabolic) are compared. The maximum surface load is up to 4\% higher with trapezoidal velocity profile which is not significant, because both velocity profiles provide 90 ft displacement. It is noted that the governing parameter for the maximum load needed is the maximum tripping acceleration, not the maximum velocity.  Improved dynamic soft string model will have significant impact on well path shape, drillstring design, drillpipe failure analysis, tripping operations optimization, and automatic control of the drawworks.}

The objective of this work was to study realistic field scale scenarios in a test well and develop a predictive model using the data. The model helps in simulating field scenarios and efficient planning of fluid logistics with significant economic impact. We present an industry first well scale study that demonstrates the impact of flow regime and solubility using Argon \\\& Nitrogen on gas migration. A 5200-ft-deep vertical test-well with 9-5/8``x2-7/8'' annulus equipped with 4 downhole pressure/temperature gauges and fiber optic DTS/DAS is utilized for the field-scale experiments. Tests were conducted by injecting gas at the bottom and observing its migration in the static mud column, followed by flushing to simulate PMCD shut-in and flushing cycles. The impact of gas solubility, bottomhole pressure (BHP) and gas injection rates were studied. Nitrogen/Argon gases were used to introduce solubility differences. To estimate gas migration rates, a mathematical model was developed and calibrated with the test data. The flow regime and gas solubility in the mud were found to be the most important factors in determining gas migration rates. Flow regime transition from Cap to Taylor bubbles was observed when BHP was rapidly dropped from 3600 to 2290 psi, with a threefold increase in gas migration rates. Argon gas migration rates were \textasciitilde{}half that of nitrogen under the same test conditions which is in line with the gas solubility differences between the two gases. The gas migration rate increased non-linearly with injection rates between 0.1 to 6 bpm. The simulation model utilized well known Cap bubble correlations along with Henry's law and was found to adequately model the test results. Reported field case histories were also modeled and the results compared well with reported gas migration rates (\textasciitilde{}0.01-0.4 ft/sec) for both water and oil-based muds. The minimum mud bullheading rate to flush gas was found to be 100 gpm (0.6 ft/sec) and was \textasciitilde{}15 \% higher than the gas migration rate; this helps in determining the minimum field required flushing rate. The gas migration model accounts for solubility in the mud, pressure in the wellbore influencing gas flow regime, and gas influx rates and predicts results in-line with observed field case histories.}

	abstract		= {This work describes an accurate method for the automatic, real-time characterization of cuttings and cavings, including their volume, size distribution, and shape/morphology. This method integrates high-resolution images and 3D data (points in 3D space), collected in real-time using an integrated laser-based sensor previously tested in the field. Additionally, we analyze the effect of the morphological characteristics of cuttings/cavings on the volume correction factor, which is a function of the void space, when these are stacked up.  The proposed method encompasses (1) the identification of individual cuttings/cavings in the data (segmentation), (2) the extraction of their morphological characteristics, and (3) the estimation of their bulk volume, as well as their effective volume (without the interstitial void space) when these are stacked. To achieve these outputs, our method incorporates (1) optimized image pre-processing methods, (2) state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, (3) ellipse-fitting algorithms, and (4) numerical integration of the 3D data. We validated the proposed method at laboratory scale simulating challenging field conditions. These conditions included poor mud/solids separation and stacked cuttings.  The assessment of the hole cleaning efficiency and wellbore stability is key to preventing undesirable non-productive time (NPT) events in drilling operations, such as stuck pipe events. The conventional method for such an assessment involves low-frequency sampling of cuttings/cavings from collector trays at the rig shale shakers, as well as their manual characterization by a human. This person infers volume, size distribution, and morphological characteristics of the returning stream. This approach results in a biased and often late evaluation of hole cleaning and wellbore stability issues, thereby missing out on opportunities to prevent NPT. Our method enables an accurate real-time characterization of cuttings/cavings, even in challenging conditions such as wet solids conditions and stacking-up. Additionally, we observed that, when the cuttings/cavings are stacked, the required correction to the initial volume estimation (derived from the integration of the 3D data) depends on their morphological characteristics, as well as the level of stacking. Since our proposed method covers these aspects, it can also provide an accurate measurement of the solids return volume, serving as basis for a timely and accurate evaluation of hole cleaning sufficiency and wellbore stability.  This work is the first to propose a holistic, automatic, and real-time characterization of cuttings/cavings, including their volume, size distribution, and shape/morphology. Furthermore, it is the first to integrate 3D data with high-resolution images to pursue this objective. The method proposed in this paper can be used for the real-time assessment of hole cleaning sufficiency and wellbore stability, and, consequently, for the prediction, prevention, and better management of NPT-producing events.}

	abstract		= {Automatic prediction of drilling incidents can be conducted through either a purely data-driven approach or a hybrid approach. In the first approach, the variable space is typically limited to surface measurements and downhole sensor data, while in the second approach, the variable space is expanded to include information from physics-based models. This paper analyzes the additional value of incorporating physics-based information to predict drilling incidents such as stuck pipe, illustrated using data from the Utah FORGE geothermal wells.  In our study, we trained three anomaly detection models with two distinct variables spaces. In the first one, we considered the real-time signals only, while in the second one, we included physics-based information derived from cuttings-transport, tortuosity, and torque-and-drag models. We selected three models that showed promising results in recent studies and represent the taxonomy of machine-learning-based anomaly detection algorithms. Specifically, we utilized recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and clustering. Finally, a comparison between the two approaches was performed in terms of the fidelity of the warnings they generated.  We observed that the inclusion of physics-based information is key to improving the performance of models for predicting drilling incidents. Specifically, we noted a reduction in the number of false alarms, which, in turn, increases the reliability of the models. In addition, we found that physics information can guide the selection of prediction time windows when drilling anomalies develop, thereby eliminating bias in the models' construction. Finally, we observed that some drilling anomalies, which were previously believed to occur suddenly with little warning, can, in fact, be predicted in a timely manner with hybrid models. These observations demonstrate that the use of hybrid models can significantly increase the performance of drilling anomaly predictions, providing sufficient forewarning time for their prevention and associated NPT avoidance.  State-of-the-art methods that implement purely data-driven and hybrid approaches have individually demonstrated high accuracy in predicting incidents on specific datasets. However, no previous comparative study has been conducted to analyze the value of incorporating physics-based information. This paper is the first to perform such an analysis for models aiming at the early detection of drilling anomalies. The results from this study provide valuable guidance for future NPT avoidance in drilling operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper will discuss the engineering process used to redesign the polycrystalline diamond cutter {(PDC)} and roller cone cutting structures of a Hybrid Bit in the challenging Foothills application of Colombia. The primary challenge to drill 14 3/4" section in Colombia foothills is high torque values its oscillations and vibration that produce premature damage of the PDC bits; specially while drilling Carbonera C5 formation, which has a very high abrasiveness and compressive strength (25 Ksi UCS). In addition to the traditional post-drilling analysis of the bit design, the use of an advanced polygonal mesh drilling simulation software in combination with laboratory test will be described as a key element to maximize the durability of the bit. This step of the process allows for the first-time an integrated analysis of the PDC/roller cone cutting structures all together. Analysis of the engagement balance along with the calculation of forces applied to the various cutting structure components, ultimately resulting in an improved optimization of bit performance beyond the common scenario considering the use of 4-5 PDC bits for the whole section.  A computational model, using a polygonal mesh simulation was developed for getting a deeper understanding of the PDC and roller cone interaction in the cutting structure of a hybrid drill bit; afterwards, this simulation software was calibrated with data from pressurized tests obtained in a drilling lab. Improvements of the bit cutting structure started with the ability to correlate the dull condition of the bit under several conditions of torque on bit (TOB), weight on bit (WOB) distribution and Depth of Cut (DOC). This, in turn, guided the bit design changes which were then validated by running the new design through the same simulation and achieving desirable results.  The optimized hybrid drill bit sets a footage record in the Foothills area drilling 50\% further than standard PDC bits and achieving 39\% more ROP than the previous hybrid bit design in offset wells. In addition to ROP and durability improvements, the original bearing \textendash{} seal life was improved from 50\% to 100\% of effectiveness with the new design for this application in this hole size. The new design features optimized the depth of cut (DOC), the weight distribution across the cutting structure and increased stability and efficiency as well. Thus, overcoming the challenge to drill further and more efficiently through these challenging formations.  A specialized team has for the first-time optimized Roller cone structure and PDC structure together improving bottomhole drilling dynamics, performance and bit reliability for this application through the combination of robust polygonal mesh simulations of the drilling process and pressurized rock drilling tests in a drilling lab.}

Lifua is one of the marginal fields within the Block 0 concession in offshore Angola. The development plan for these marginal fields requires short-cycle and cost-effective designs to be economically feasible. Utilizing a minimum functional objective approach, Lifua-A was planned as a proof-of-concept for this strategy which involves a repeatable solution developing a standard wellhead platform design, standard well designs and a factory-repeatable platform fabrication, installation and well execution process.  The STS design was the selected solution for the development of the Lifua field. This rig-installable platform design was first developed and installed in offshore Indonesia in 1995 with slots for three wells and rated for 150 ft of water depth. Lifua-A STS is a ten-well platform with a planned installation at a water depth of 205 ft. As a result, a new enhanced STS design and installation procedure was required. As the structural design work and fabrication progressed, the technical requirements for the jack-up rig were also developed. Upon contracting the rig, detailed engineering work was undertaken to modify the rig's cantilever system to meet the lifting and installation requirements of the STS modules. The upgrade increased the rig's cantilever longitudinal skidding capability to 85 ft with a lifting capacity of 400MT. In addition, engineering work was carried out to size and install a hydraulic hammer on the rig floor to drive the 42-in. and 36-in. conductors. Finally, the laying of the subsea flexible production flowline, thermoplastic composite water injection pipeline, and subsea power cable were all engineered in a way where they could be pulled in and up the STS platform from the rig floor utilizing a drillpipe-sling assembly and a winch cable.  The installation of the Lifua-A STS was executed according to plan, achieving the short-cycle objective by delivering the project within three years from FID to first oil. In addition, the project planning and execution was successfully carried out during the COVID pandemic. One key success factor was having the cross-functional groups working together as one team, from the development of the design to fabricating the structures and actual offshore installation. Lifua-A unlocked the marginal reserves of the Lifua field by stretching the limit of the application of the STS. This success opens the possibility of utilizing the same solution to other similar marginal fields.}

Previously, the operator has drilled a similar hole opening section in this marginal field with two separate runs. The directional requirements combined with low WOB took the operator three days to drill and open the 640m section. For the new drilling campaign, the reservoir objectives were to drill deeper and to appraise the well, with an option to complete and produce the gas reservoirs if there are any discoveries. The operator requested the hole be drilled with hole enlargement while drilling (HEWD) tools in a single run, with real-time logging tools. This technique would eliminate the requirement for extra 8\textonehalf{}\textquotedblright{} pilot hole thus significantly reduce rig-days.  Designing a robust and durable BHA for the 1370m long directional run demands intricate planning. To ensure the three cutting structures would synchronize and work in harmony, a pre-job FEA-based modeling system was used to investigate the dynamic drilling behavior of the BHA. The results of simulations from the initial BHA predicted very high vibrations which could potentially result in tool damage. A BHA optimization analysis was then conducted to enhance the BHA design to eliminate vibration issues. The simulation results of the optimized BHA design exhibited measurable reduction in vibration levels.  The operator implemented the recommended BHA and a total of 1371m was successfully drilled and opened in one run, in just four days. All directional requirements were met and a good set of survey and log data was transmitted up the well without issues. Compared with the traditional two run approach, the single run yielded a 25\\% time savings to the operator. No vibrations were recorded and the BHA was pulled at section TD with no significant wear on the three cutting structures. There were no issues running casing, which implies good borehole quality.}

	abstract		= {Various stabilizer types are used in the industry, such as bladed stabilizers with straight or spiral blades, roller-reamers, and other emergent forms. Their designs are proved, via many in-field measurements, to have a significant impact on vibration levels. Although experimental data is extremely valuable to rank the available design options, testing the different stabilizers can be costly and sometimes risky. In addition,in-field conditions can be difficult to control making the comparisons between stabilizers even more complicated. Assessing the design impact using numerical simulations represents an interesting alternative to provide objective comparisons based on tests in a controlled environment.  When a stabilizer is rotating, the contact forces between its different blades and the wellbore are transient.  A static approach like torque and drag or directional models is then insufficient to properly investigate the stabilizer's design characteristics. Therefore, a time-domain dynamics approach is adopted in this work. A detailed modeling of bladed stabilizers including the blade geometry (number of blades, spirality, and blade width) and friction characteristics are introduced in an existing time-domain model. These characteristically are used to compute the contact forces between the wellbore and each individual blade.  This numerical model is applied to quantify the effect of stabilizer design in terms of vibration, from straight blades to highly spiraled blades. First, a parametric study of blade design and wellbore inclination effects on stabilizer vibrations is presented by considering different stabilizers in straight well conditions.  Simulations of an actual drill string configuration in an unconventional well is discussed. For vertical,curved, and horizontal sections, the acceleration levels, contact forces, and rotation speeds are investigated.  These analyses can constitute guidelines about stabilizer design to minimize vibrations.  The novelty of this work is to introduce the geometry details of the stabilizers in the time-domain dynamics to differentiate designs in terms of likelihood to trigger vibrations.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes how high-density cesium/potassium (Cs/K) formate fluids were successfully utilised from reservoir drilling to upper completion installation in five productive Martin Linge high-rate gas wells. Four wells were completed with openhole gravel pack and one with standalone sand screens.  The gravel packing operation marks what is considered to be the highest density carrier fluid openhole gravel pack successfully completed worldwide, with SG 2.06. A complex operation under near-high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) conditions, including managed pressure drilling (MPD), overbalanced screen running and openhole gravel packing, was simplified by utilising the same fluid throughout the operation.  Cs/K formate reservoir drilling fluid and screen-running fluid were designed with biopolymeric additives and minimal calcium carbonate bridging particles. Clear Cs/K formate brine (i.e., without biopolymeric additives and particles) was chosen as gravel pack carrier fluid. The use of Cs/K formate fluids for all stages of the operation reduced the complexity of transitioning between the operational stages. In addition, the reservoir was only exposed to one filtrate without application of damaging weighting solids.  The drilling fluid contributed to successful MPD and delivered wells with very good hole quality in the reservoir, which consisted of interbedded sandstone, coal stringers and shale. The shale stabilising properties of concentrated formate brine\textendash{}based fluids provided acceptable conditions for extended openhole time and allowed additional logging runs, including pore pressure measurements, under near-HP/HT conditions before running the screens. One bottom-up cleanout was conducted before the screen-running fluid was circulated in and the screens installed. The spurt and seepage losses were low throughout the drilling and screen running phases. No breaker treatment was required in any of the wells. All wells have proven to have good initial productivity and high well productive efficiency as expected.  The record-breaking openhole gravel pack operations performed with the high fluid densities required in Equinor's Martin Linge field have set a new standard for completing in challenging high-pressure environments.}

	abstract		= {Torsional stick-slip vibrations are a significant cause of drill string damage and failure. Using damping subs distributed along the drill string has been demonstrated in both simulations and laboratory experiments as a viable solution to reduce stick-slip in drilling. The effectiveness in mitigating stick-slip can be further improved through active control of the damping strength of one or several subs. This paper evaluates a control scheme, which relies only on local downhole measurements, for various operating conditions simulated with a drill string mechanics model. Damping subs with sleeves supported on bearings and incorporated eddy current brakes are installed along the drill string, adding viscous damping to the system to mitigate torsional vibrations. The damping amount is proportional to the relative rotational speed between the sleeve and the pipe, and therefore maximized when the sleeves are non-rotating. However, if the braking force surpasses the static friction holding the sleeve in place, the sleeve slips and reduces its braking abilities. To counteract this, an On-Off-based control scheme with proportional control (P-Off controller) is implemented at the level of each sub to manipulate the value of its damping coefficient. The Off condition is triggered when local measurements indicate slipping of the sleeve. Simulations of various drilling scenarios conducted with a coupled axial and torsional drill string model show that the P-Off controller can reduce stick-slip in the system in both off-bottom and on-bottom conditions. The results indicate that the average damping coefficient, and implicitly the torque added to the system, can be greatly reduced compared to a passive damping system, consisting of the same number and positioning of subs but with constant damping coefficients. Also, the settling time of the downhole rotational speed is significantly reduced compared to the passive system. The control scheme is decentralized as it relies only on local knowledge, such as pipe rotational speed inferred from an inertial measurement unit, to estimate the top drive revolutions per minute (RPM) setpoint. Therefore, communication with the surface or with neighboring subs is not a requirement for the control implementation. The controller also shows robustness against variations in the top drive RPM and noisy downhole measurements, which is important for a real-world application. The presented approach differs from existing downhole torsional vibration damping solutions, as it does not rely on a single tool placed inside or near the bottom-hole assembly, but on several subs distributed along the drill string, with their damping strength adjusted directly downhole in a decentralized manner.}

	abstract		= {Annular shale creep barriers which can guarantee long-term well integrity over the entire lifespan of the well can be stimulated by temperature elevation caused by artificial heating inside the wellbore. Prior work has shown that heating can significantly accelerate barrier formation, but may also damage the shale formation if certain temperatures are applied. This paper reports on the optimum thermal conditions for shale barrier formation based on extensive new laboratory as well as literature data.  Thermally accelerated creep behavior was studied for the Lark and the Shetland North Sea shales. Large-scale triaxial equipment was used to study the behavior of shales under downhole stress and pressure conditions while varying temperature. In addition, an extensive literature study investigated the thermal effect of shales used for nuclear containment, such as the Boom Clay in Belgium, Cox Shale in France, and Opalinus Clay in Switzerland. The investigation focused on the impacts of temperature elevation on important shale properties such as creep rate, sealing and self-healing ability, and temperature-induced porosity, permeability, and mineralogical changes.  Both the laboratory investigation and the literature study showed that there is an optimum range for artificial thermal stimulation of shale barriers, with an upper temperature of 200°C \textendash{} 300\textdegree{}C that should not be exceeded. At lower temperatures, thermal pore fluid expansion may lead to effective stress reduction and shear failure on shale bedding planes. In the optimum range, fluid thermal expansion is effectively negated by thermally-induced shale consolidation, and barrier formation is optimally accelerated, which is of great practical value for field implementations. Above the optimum range, irreversible dehydration and metamorphosis of the clay constituent of the shale happen and the shale loses its ability to creep to form a barrier and self-heal. This important result shows that heating inside wellbores to improve/accelerate creep of shales needs to be a controlled, engineered process in order to yield a competent barrier. This favors the use of a temperature-controlled heater rather than a less-controllable exothermic reaction.  Shale barriers seal annuli much better and more reliably than cement barriers. Moreover, their self-healing ability offers the ability to guarantee annular well integrity for an indefinite period, including the P\\\&A phase. Thermal stimulation is preferred by operators to accelerate barrier formation without requiring annular access. The findings of this paper provide important theoretical and practical guidance on how to optimally stimulate shale barriers and avoid pitfalls associated with thermally-induced shale damage.}

	abstract		= {Well integrity issues have been widely studied in the oil and gas sector; however, with storage wells (e.g. towards natural gas, CO2 and H2), new challenges may arise due to the reactivity of the stored fluid in contact with well barrier materials, including migration and leakage of fluids. It is therefore essential to study the reaction of fluids with cement in well conditions to be able to predict the evolution of the cement annulus when exposed to fluids.  We have performed fluid flow experiments through realistic cracks in an annular cement sheath in a downscaled wellbore section. Two different experimental procedures to measure fluid flow have been investigated. The setup consists of a steel casing, cement sheath and surrounding rock. This setup provides a unique possibility to perform pressure cycling experiments to investigate cement sheath integrity and subsequent flow measurement across the 30—cm long cement sheath.  We compare the evolution of the flow rate of both gas (N2) and brine (liquid). Fluid flow testing with N2 and brine provides a reference measurement of the micro annuli permeability for both liquid and gas phases. As nitrogen does not react with cement, it provides a reference flow measurement. This paper reports initial and new results, measuring fluid flow as a function of inner casing pressure of a downscaled wellbore section.}

	abstract		= {Despite advances in Measurement-While-Drilling / Logging-While-Drilling (MWD/LWD) technologies, the oil \& gas industry has until recently lacked viable technologies and tools to measure wellbore geometry in large hole sizes ($>$12-1/4'') while drilling and subsequently the ability to visualize and describe the borehole shape and size in an intuitive way.  A direct mechanical measurement solution such as used on wireline, e.g., multi-finger tools, is not feasible to implement on MWD/LWD tools due to the nature of the drilling operation. Conventional technologies and methods, including acoustic- and density-based measurement methods have been used with reasonable results in smaller hole sizes ($\leq$12-1/4'') when combined with low mud weights. However,many commercially available tools within the industry have low vertical and azimuthal resolution due to sparse sampling or sparse storing in its internal downhole memory of such caliper measurements, resulting in limited use of such data for borehole shape and size purposes. Such conventional technologies and methods have not been, or very seldom used in large hole sizes, primarily due to lack of available technologies and tools, resulting from challenges related to the sensor to wellbore interface standoff distance.  A novel Logging-While-Drilling Caliper tool based on impulse radar technology has been developed to overcome the challenges related to mud weight, sensor to wellbore standoff in oil-based muds and at the same time addressing challenges related to sparse datasets. This tool enables the oil and gas industry to accurately image borehole shape and size with both high vertical and azimuthal resolution, including within large hole sizes where there has not been any viable solution whilst drilling. The high sampling rate together with a large downhole memory (128 GB) allows the industry to evaluate the borehole shape and size as a function of time (time lapse).  An Impulse Radar Caliper tool has been pilot tested in several wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), in borehole sections ranging from 12-1/4'' to 17-1/2''. During the pilot testing, the Impulse Radar Caliper tool acquired wellbore shape and size measurements while drilling, and some intervals while pulling out of hole. Several wellbore features, not previously imaged in such large hole sizes, have been identified and their time-dependent development studied in detail. The results from this pilot campaign are discussed in this paper together with the 3D/4D tunnel-view visualization used to assess the processed caliper measurements.}

	abstract		= {A new LWD sensor is introduced for measuring a high-resolution borehole image in large boreholes and both in light and heavy oil base mud. The new sensor uses advanced radar technology, and in addition to caliper (time-of-flight) image, delivers an electrical image to help geoscientists visualize and understand the stratigraphy and fractures.  A pulse radar operating in the multi-gigahertz range is implemented within the bottom hole assembly. As the BHA rotates, the radar measurements scan the borehole surface. The time of flight is converted to a distance to the borehole wall. The amplitude of the reflected signal correlates with the micro-resistivity/permittivity of the formation in the immediate vicinity of the borehole.  Up until recently, sensors capable of performing these caliper measurements while drilling have been limited to smaller size boreholes and lighter muds. A new technology, based on a downhole radar rotating with the bottom hole assembly extends the application to boreholes of 18 inches and more in oil base mud. The same technology yields a micro-resistivity/permittivity image that is prized by the geoscientists for recognizing key geological features, including layered formations, fractures, faults, and unconformities. Here again the new technology is the first to our knowledge to obtain such information while drilling in large holes and light and heavy oil base mud.  A new technology, namely the downhole pulsed GHz radar brings a new solution to well-known problems. High resolution calipers and micro-resistivity images while drilling have been made available to the industry in recent years, however they are restricted to smaller than 12 ¼`` boreholes and water base mud. The article below explains how and how well the new technology has significantly increased the range of applicability to oil base mud for large hole sizes, like 12 \textonequarter{}" and 17-1/2''.}

	abstract		= {Finding information across multiple databases, formats, and documents remains a manual job in the drilling industry. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in data-aggregation tasks, including answering questions. However, using LLMs for domain-specific factual responses poses a nontrivial challenge. The expert labor cost for training domain-specific LLMs prohibits niche industries from developing custom question-answering bots. This paper tests several commercial LLMs for information retrieval tasks for drilling data using zero-shot in-context learning. In addition, we studied the model’s calibration using a few-shot multiple-choice drilling questionnaire.  To create an LLM benchmark for drilling, we collated the text data from publicly available databases: the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), company annual reports, and petroleum glossary. We used a zero-shot learning technique that relies on an LLM’s ability to generate responses for tasks outside its training. We implemented a controlled zero-shot learning ``in-context'' procedure that sends a user’s query augmented with text data to the LLM as inputs. This implementation encourages the LLM to take the answer from the data while leveraging its pre-trained contextual-learning capability.  We evaluated several state-of-the-art generic LLMs available through an API, including G4, G3.5-TI, J2-ultra model, and L2 series. The paper documents the pre-trained LLMs’ ability to provide correct answers and identify petroleum industry jargon from the collated dataset. Our zero-shot in-context learning implementation helps vanilla LLMs provide relevant factual responses for the drilling domain. While each LLM’s performance varies, we have identified models suitable for a drilling chatbot application. In particular, G4 outperformed on all the tasks. This finding suggests that training expensive domain-specific LLMs is not necessary for question-answering tasks in the context of drilling data.  We demonstrate the utility of zero-shot in-context learning using pre-trained LLMs for question-answering tasks relevant to the drilling industry. Additionally, we prepared and publicly released the collated datasets from the NPD database and companies’ annual reports to enable results reproducibility and to foster acceleration of language model adoption and development for the subsurface and drilling industries. The petroleum industry may find our solution beneficial for enhancing personnel training and career development. It also offers a method for conducting data analytics and overcoming challenges in retrieving historical well data.}

	abstract		= {Verification of annular well barrier elements is an essential process during the well construction and plug and abandonment phases. This topic has been the subject of many publications and is governed by regulations in different countries around the world. In this paper we focus on the evaluation of shale creep barriers. We describe how sonic and ultrasonic pulse-echo and pitch-catch configuration data are used to monitor the evolution of formations creep around the casing to eventually form annular barriers.  Multiple annulus logging evaluations were performed across wells from the Valhall, Ula, Alvheim, and Jette fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). This was done using ultrasonic pulse-echo and pitch-catch configuration data as well as traditional sonic logs. The logging data were collected, reprocessed, and compared as part of a collaborative effort between the operator and a service company. In this study we examine the progression of annular solids through time from formation creep.  Our intention was to study the ability of shales creep to form barriers, and to simplify the well design and achieve isolation around the production casing without the need for conventional cementing operations.  The log data provide information of annulus material with a detailed map of the axial and azimuthal variations of the annulus contents. Crossplotting state-of-the-art measurements also helps to identify the material accumulating in the annulus as published in many other industry papers. This approach has garnered interest over the years as a novel solution during well abandonment operations. The results provide solid evidence of shale creep-forming barriers and has been used by the operator to further refine their zonal isolation strategy.  Comparing ultrasonic data with a particular interest on the progression of formation creep, has become a popular subject within the NCS. Innovative use of historical logging data holds a great potential to help make decisions that result in reduced cost and environmental impact. Because of this novel usage and analysis of ultrasonic logging data, the operator was able to make informed decisions faster, saving rig time and cost while reducing the carbon footprint.}

Inefficiency and damaging bit and bottom hole assembly (BHA) vibrations, caused by improper bit and reamer selection when drilling through interbedded formations and formation transitions, are a leading cause of inconsistent performance including excessive torque, low rate of penetration (ROP) and downhole tool failures (DTF). To mitigate vibrations, operators required a comprehensive analysis system/process that would allow them to model the complex BHA interaction in a virtual environment and quantitatively compare the performance of various design scenarios.  To solve the challenge, the drilling team utilized a comprehensive, 4-D finite element model that couples laboratory results with a sophisticated computer simulator that calculates the drilling system’s dynamic performance from the bit back to surface in a real-time domain. Unlike other modeling programs that assume the contact forces between the cutter and rock, this advanced model utilizes exact cutting structure details coupled with the laboratory-derived rock mechanics to accurately predict the behavior of the bit and reamer with the entire drill string and bottom hole assembly. The effects of each specific BHA component and variations in drilling parameters on vibrations, ROP, and directional tendency can then be quantitatively evaluated.}

Experience has shown that the efficiency of the process depends strongly upon the appropriateness and significance of the data collected. If, for example, a dominant cutter failure mechanism is incorrectly characterized as abrasive wear and is, in fact, impact wear, then the proposed solution and the development time will both be significantly affected.  One method for improving the significance of the data collected is to implement a special-purpose data-acquisition system within the bit. Such a device has at least three significant advantages over available sub-based data-acquisition systems: (1) its bit-based sensors will more accurately detect bit-based events, (2) it can be economically deployed over many bits and (3) it is relatively transparent to the user.  The paper describes an effort to develop, validate, and utilize a bit-based module designed to monitor accelerometer and magnetometer sensors and to record selected data. The authors also describe the effort to infer dynamic dysfunction(s) from the data in the fast-growing hard rock PDC bit application and to mitigate them via modifications to drilling parameters and bit designs.}

	abstract		= {The drilling industry has substantially improved performance based on knowledge from physics-based, statistical, and empirical models of components and systems.  However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements.  The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts.  The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started.  Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature.  Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles.  Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP).  The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained.  As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models.  The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a "theory" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models.  In May 2018 at "The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems," the keynote question was, "Is it time to start using open source models?" The answer is "yes".  Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible.  An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.}

	abstract		= {In this paper we make the case that data science captures value in well construction when data analysis methods, such as machine learning, are underpinned by first principles derived from physics and engineering and supported by deep domain expertise.  Despite receiving wide attention in recent years, many organizations currently struggle to derive value from their data science efforts. In our experience, disappointment arises for a multitude of reasons, which we discuss in detail. Key issues that often hinder value capture include poor data management, challenges in working with WITSML data, lack of well construction domain expertise by data science teams, inadequate use of physics and engineering and failure to adopt data science solutions into existing or new well construction workflows.  Although by no means comprehensive, we provide a summary of important data that pertains to the well construction process. We further discuss high-level areas where data science can add value to well construction through analysis of such data. Data science initiatives typically fit within at least one of the following categories: Historical Studies, Well Planning, Real-Time Well Construction Execution and Post-Drill Learning Capture. Historical studies are often good places for data science teams to initially focus their efforts. However, as insights are drawn and potential for value is shown, organizations should consider extending capabilities developed to carry-out historical studies to support well planning and real-time well construction execution workflows.  A large portion of this paper is dedicated to discussing ways that organizations can work to improve their abilities to derive value from data science efforts. Most of the discussion focuses on steps that data science teams can take today. However, our commentary on data management and governance is more forward looking. Important topics which we cover include:Data management and governance.  Serving data to data scientists.  Working with WITSML data.  Basic skills and technologies needed by data science teams.  Importance of building common capabilities for working with data.  Need for physics and engineering to inform data analysis.  Importance of identifying data quality issues.  Importance of activity-based data filtering when working with WITSML data.  Dysfunction detection using WITSML data.  Application of statistics and machine learning.  We conclude by examining several historical data science case studies for well construction. Each example highlights the need to connect data and some physical or engineering process (i.e., ``engineering with data'') to deliver value through data science.}

	abstract		= {Accurate wellbore placement and collision avoidance are increasingly important in today's tightly spaced horizontal wells and congested fields. Modern well plans incorporate hydraulic fracture geometry, reservoir characteristics, and other factors to maximize reservoir extraction while minimizing drilling costs and safety risks. Directional surveys that have minimal uncertainty are crucial to drilling the optimized well plan. This work enables more accurate directional surveys and wellbore placement through site-specific high accuracy magnetic models.  Under the Industry Steering Committee on Wellbore Survey Accuracy (ISCWSA) error model, the use of In-Field geomagnetic Referencing (IFR) dramatically reduces some of the largest sources of error in wellbore location. Unfortunately, IFR can be expensive or out of reach for smaller or less mature basins because of the high cost of flying or purchasing high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys. An economic and timely alternative has been developed, strategically taking ground magnetic measurements at sites along the wellbore(s) with absolute instruments, combined with a high-definition global magnetic model to produce IFR at the pad scale.  This method was tested in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado. A small survey team collected ground magnetic measurements over a typical pad design in one day. The data was then processed and combined with a high-definition global magnetic model to produce IFR corrections locally for the pad. This study demonstrates that the procedure reduces the horizontal wellbore position uncertainty by 46\% for the study area and more generally from 15 to 50 percent when compared to standard MWD (Measurement While Drilling) survey technology. Furthermore, this method was compared to a typical IFR model created from airborne measurements. We found that the results from the comparison agreed within tolerance to the IFR model and validated the use for IFR corrections at a pad scale. This technique improves confidence in wellbore placement, mitigates collision risks, improves reservoir drainage, and helps to maximize production.  Much work on the construction of IFR magnetic models from airborne total field data for large areas has been done. This work is novel in that it describes the construction of an IFR magnetic model from a small number of ground magnetic vector measurements, in combination with a high-definition global magnetic model for a small area. This innovative approach makes IFR corrections significantly more accessible to drilling programs with shorter timelines, fewer wells, and smaller budgets.}

	abstract		= {The bit-rock interaction has long been studied to assess PDC drill bit performance, which is driven both by cutting and non-cutting parts of the drill bit. While the cutter-rock interaction has been studied by many authors in the literature, only a few studies have focused on the interaction between the rock and non-cutting parts of the drill bit.  In this paper, we introduce a new method designed to model the interaction between the whole drill bit and the rock formation within a full three-dimensional framework. This approach is based on a generic computational geometry algorithm which simulates the drilling process considering both the drill bit and the hole being drilled as a set of 3D meshed surfaces. The volume of rock removed by the PDC cutters as well as the area and the volume of contact between the rock and the non-cutting parts of the drill bit can be computed with a high accuracy based on the 3D CAD model of the drill bit.  The in-house drill bit simulator implementing this algorithm primarily allows the engineer to estimate how bit-rock interactions distribute between cutting and non-cutting parts of the drill bit and to balance the bit design in the 3D space accordingly over a given range of drilling parameters. This approach has been brought to the field in order to address cutter breakage based on rubbing contacts optimization. Field results associated to some case studies in US shale plays and Canada are described and clearly show that contact points predictions closely match field observations. Moreover, design modifications applied following this process have led to an overall increase in bit performance and bit durability while preventing core-out issues.  The bit design methodology presented in this paper is dedicated to design drill bits whose interaction with the rock formation is predicted with a higher accuracy by accounting for the exact 3D shape of the drill bit.},

	abstract		= {Simulating the mechanical response of PDC drill bits contains a lot of uncertainties. Rock and fluid properties are generally poorly known, complex interactions occur downhole and physical models can hardly capture the full complexity of downhole phenomena. This paper presents a statistical approach that improves the reliability of the PDC bit design optimization process by ensuring that the expected directional behavior of the drill bit is robust over a well-defined range of drilling parameters.  It is first examined how uncertainty propagates through an accurate bit/rock interaction model which simulates numerically the interaction between a given PDC drill bit geometry and a given rock formation, both represented as 3D meshed surfaces. Series of simulations have been launched with simulation parameters defined as probability density functions. The focus has been set on directional drilling simulations where the drill bit is subjected to significant variations in contact loads on gage pads along its trajectory. A global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to identify the key parameters which control drilling performance.  Directional system parameters are critical in terms of steerability and tool face control, particularly in high dogleg severity applications. Based on these simulations, a statistical optimization strategy has then been implemented to ensure that the directional performance of the drill bit remains effective under a given uncertain drilling environment. Statistical analysis combined with drilling simulations indicated that ROP improvements could even be achieved without compromising steerability. A balanced bit design was selected and manufactured in an 8 1/2-in. model to drill a 714 ft section of a Kuwait field. The bit was run on a high dogleg rotary steerable system and directional assembly. The bit achieved the high steerability goals required by the application while showing a good compatibility with the directional tool. Moreover, ROP was increased by approximately 27\% compared to offset wells, setting a record rate of penetration in the field.  Whereas statistical analyses are commonly conducted in the field of geosciences, it has rarely been applied in the field of drilling applications. The statistical bit design optimization strategy deployed in this work has allowed to improve both the drilling performance of the drill bit and its reliability.},

	abstract		= {The past few years have seen many experienced drilling operations personnel retire. Coincidently, the industry saw an increase in the number of drillstring failures, some of which could have potentially been avoided. These failures can result in non-productive time (NPT) like fishing trips, side tracking, or exorbitant repair bills, all of which can be costly. The consequence of these failures can be steep, and the objective of this paper is to assist with recognition and prevention of these failures. The number and type of field failures allow us to identify areas of neglect in which shared best practices may have been forgotten or not passed on. A renewed advocation of these essential drillstring running practices will help to mitigate issues before they cause operation disruption and budget overage.  In identifying issues, our intent is to recognize observed variances in running and handling practices that have potential to add complications to well construction, exacerbate budgets, and/or possibly create unsafe working environments. The solutions presented are based on actual field cases and have proven effective. More than ever, variances in best operational practices when running the string have immediate or long-term consequences. Whether the task is slips setting, connection makeup or breakout, elevator positioning, thread compound application, etc., all operations can be poorly executed when adequate information/education is not shared/passed on. As a result, over-torquing (uncontrolled down hole make-up) or, on the flipside, loosening of connections (reactive torque) is far too common and is intensified by the increase of laterals lengths.  One cannot ignore our industry's extreme drive on operation efficiency and cost reduction. Unfortunately, ignoring best practices or minimizing proven steps can be counterproductive, especially in today's more complex wellbore trajectories and demanding drilling programs. The expected outcome of this paper is to identify poor procedural conduct, explain consequences of the same, and inform drilling operations personnel with operational alternatives that will yield results. Explaining the importance and value of these best practices can renew an industry culture driven by safety and performance. Knowing and, more importantly, understanding why procedures require improvement will promote a virtuous behavior. This includes understanding the touch points and critical interfaces that the string has with the rig surface pipe handling equipment, in particular the iron roughneck and the top drive.}

	abstract		= {Observation of cuttings and cavings serves as an important early indicator for hole cleaning and wellbore instability problems. Automation of this critical monitoring process is, however, still in its infancy. This paper highlights the development and initial field testing of a new automated cuttings and cavings monitoring sensor system. Initial challenges identified in an earlier field test, and their solutions that have been incorporated into this new working field prototype, are presented.  The imaging sensors selected for the prototype, including a 3D laser profile scanner and a machine vision camera, were used in an initial field trial to assess the feasibility of building a prototype that can operate in a harsh field environment. Based on that initial field trial, the prototype was built, and preliminary outdoor tests were conducted offsite to validate its performance. Following that, a second field trial at an active drilling site in West Texas was conducted to assess the implementation and performance of the prototype in the field.  Practical solutions to key challenges identified in the first field trial were successfully implemented in the new prototype, and its field performance was validated in the second field trial where the prototype was integrated into the solids control system of an active drilling rig, successfully collecting data for during drilling operations. The system accurately measured the volumetric return of cuttings, and the tests demonstrate the ability to determine the cuttings size distribution and detect anomalous-sized cavings. The results can be used directly for improved hole cleaning management and stuck pipe avoidance in field operations.  This paper introduces the first working prototype of a 3D-imaging cuttings monitoring system that could be taken into production for quantifying the volumetric return of cuttings on surface and providing information about the size and shape of cuttings and cavings. The development of this cuttings sensor is a major milestone in the field of drilling automation, bringing the industry closer to achieving a fully automated hole cleaning and stuck pipe prevention system.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes a new approach to understand the causes of stick-slip vibrations experienced by PDC bits. This new model takes into consideration not only the axial and torsional modes of vibration, but also the coupling between these two modes through bit-rock interaction laws, which are consistent with laboratory results from single cutter experiments. These interaction laws, which account for both frictional contact and cutting processes at the bit-rock interface, are formulated in terms of the depth of cut, a variable that brings into the equations the position of the bit at a previous a priori unknown time. They also account for potential loss of frictional contact between the wear-flats and the rock. The delayed and coupled nature of this interaction is ultimately responsible for the occurrence of self-excited vibrations, which can degenerate into stick-slip oscillations under certain conditions. The features of the torsional vibrations that are predicted with this model are well in accordance with field observations. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model predicts apparent rate effects as an inherent outcome of the nature of the bit-rock interface.}

	abstract		= {There is a growing need for robust and efficient abandonment approaches with many oil and gas reservoirs nearing their economic lifetime. The Through-Tubing Abandonment (TTA) approach can deliver safe, robust and efficient isolation and reduced environmental footprint in keeping with ‘As Low as Reasonably Practicable’ (ALARP) principles. This paper provides guidance on how to select TTA candidate wells, including wells with gauge cables present in the permanent isolation interval, and provides operational advice to obtain a quality abandonment.  The industry has been abandoning wells via through tubing cementing methods for decades which has resulted in significant progress in the understanding of the applicability of the methodology and commensurate development of suitable technologies to deliver reliable long-term isolation. This paper will present the latest on selection criteria to screen wells for TTA. It will further propose cement placement and verification methods, necessary barrier lengths and risk-based decision making on the acceptability of gauge cables as part of the final permanent well barrier element.  The recent insights in TTA technologies and their use are described. These include demonstrated technologies such as expanding cement and vibration tools to enhance cement placement and options to log and verify the isolations. Testing results on cement sealing with gauge cables incorporated in the cemented annulus are also presented. Furthermore, promising emerging technologies such as methods to centralize the tubing to improve cement placement will be described.  Recent TTA applications in Europe, onshore and offshore, are presented as examples to illustrate current industry experience and the viability and reliability of such approaches.  A generally accepted, safe, robust and reliable approach towards TTA in keeping with ALARP principles common to the industry is pursued within this paper in order to enable acceptance and growth of TTA and associated technologies, and thereby further enable the wider application of rigless abandonment across the industry.}

	abstract		= {Drilling automation technology has been successfully deployed and in operation for several years. While the technologies covered in this paper had already been deployed separately in other regions, this case study is not only Malaysia's first drilling automation project but also the world's first deployment that includes the automation platform combined with two third-party closed-loop control applications (Apps). The study details the technologies, their implementation approach, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the project.  Technical and procedural measures necessary to ensure the safe and efficient use of the system are explained. The project's measured KPIs were collected and analyzed throughout multiple wells and are presented in the paper to measure the performance and success of the project.  Throughout the execution of the project, the automation platform successfully coordinated control ownership of the two Apps. A comparison by the drilling contractor of KPIs with and without the automation technology successfully validates the benefits in performance and consistency.}

	abstract		= {Gas Technology Institute (GTI) has been the leading investigator in the field of high power laser applications research for well construction and completion applications. Since 1997, GTI (then as Gas Research Institute- GRI) has investigated several military and industrial laser systems and their ability to cut and drill into reservoir type rocks. In this report, GTI continues its investigation with a 5.34 kW ytterbium-doped multi-clad high power fiber laser (HPFL). When compared to its competitors; the HPFL represents a technology that is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair.  Work performed under this contract included design and implementation of laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of high power laser energy on a variety of rock types. All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole. The results of this experiment will assist in the development of a downhole laser perforation or side tracking prototype tool.  To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone. The focus of the experiments was on laser/rock interaction under confining pressure as would be the case for all drilling and completion operations. As such, the results would be applicable to drilling, perforation, and side tracking applications.  In the past, several combinations of laser and rock variables were investigated at standard conditions and reported in the literature. More recent experiments determined the technical feasibility of laser perforation on multiple samples of rock, cement and steel.  The fiber laser was capable of penetrating these materials under a variety of conditions, to an appropriate depth, and with reasonable energy requirements. It was determined that fiber lasers are capable of cutting rock without causing damage to flow properties.  Furthermore, the laser perforation resulted in permeability improvements on the exposed rock surface.  This report has been prepared in two parts and each part may be treated as a stand-alone document.  Part 1 (High Energy Laser Drilling) includes the general description of the concept and focuses on results from experiments under the ambient lab conditions.  Part 2 (High Energy Laser Perforation and Completion Techniques) discusses the design and development of a customized laser pressure cell; experimental design and procedures, and the resulting data on pressure-charged samples exposed to the laser beam. An analysis provides the resulting effect of downhole pressure conditions on the laser/rock interaction process.}

	abstract		= {Bullheading involves pumping produced fluids back into the formation using a kill-fluid. A key operational parameter is the required bullheading rate which depends on surface pressure, available horsepower, and erosion limits. There is wide variation in current guidelines for bullheading rates, especially for large-diameter wellbores. Therefore, a well-scale bullheading test program was conducted using a 5200-ft-deep vertical well with 9-5/8''x2-7/8'' casing/tubing annulus located at LSU test well facility. The tubing was instrumented with 4 downhole pressure gauges and fiber optic DTS/DAS to obtain data on the downhole flow dynamics and determine bullheading efficiencies. In a typical test, a large nitrogen cap placed at the top of the annulus was bullheaded by pumping fluid in annulus with continuous returns taken from the tubing side. Tests were conducted with varying fluid rates (50 to 500 gpm), initial gas-cap size (30-60 bbl), gas pressurization method and kill fluids (water and synthetic base mud). It was observed that the bullheading process involves simultaneous gas compression, gas bubble breakage, gas dispersion, and gas displacement, unlike the typical assumption of bullheading a large gas slug. The breakage of the initial gas slug depended on the surface pressure and the extent of gas-liquid mixing. The minimum water flowrate required for gas bullheading matched to water velocity just above small bubble velocity in water. Increase in water flowrate increased the bullheading efficiency, e.g., bullheading with 350 gpm required $<$50\% water volume compared to 150 gpm water flowrate. Experiments with a highly pressurized initial gas cap and a larger initial gas cap volume resulted in relatively more efficient bullheading due to lower slip velocity resulting from higher average gas-holdup in the gas-swarm. In one test, the gas was bullheaded for some time and then allowed to migrate upward in a shut-in well. It was observed that the gas migration velocity (0.71 ft/sec) was higher than the gas slip velocity during bullheading (0.3-0.6 ft/sec). Contrary to the popular belief, the gas also did not carry its pressure while migrating in a shut in well. The experimental observation of bubbly flow instead of slug flow during bullheading under sufficiently higher surface pressure helped understand the multiphase flow dynamics of bullheading and it can help provide realistic bullheading guidelines based on well conditions.}

Throughout the life of a well, degradation of the mud system in the annulus can lead to migration of mud solids, which settle at areas of high deviation or increased dogleg severity or at above the top of the cement. In this process strong engineering model is needed in addition to the logging runs to maximize the length of the cut casings, to establish higher accuracy to estimate the cutting depth. Increased reliability for Cut and Pull in a single cut/trip is needed so that it provides safety to avoid flowing fluids to mitigate barrier breakdown. Cut and pull the casing pipe conditions require fast and accurate response. This paper describes an analytical model through which drag calculations are modified to determine: the force at the deepest cut point within the given limits of the pipe conditions; the measured weight or overpull within the margin required to pull; the measured weight required pull at any depth. The total drag is the sum of the mechanical frictional forces acting on the casing during the pull operation and the fluid frictional forces due to the fluid contact with the inside and outside of the casing. In addition, any solids packed around the casing will exert a frictional force with the outside of the casing. Kinetic friction and shear force required to break the bonding are also included. The percentage of solids and sediments and length of the contaminants are estimated through logs.}

Several variables with estimated indications are monitored in real-time, and a comprehensive index is used to measure the runnability of the casing. An evaluation of whether the casing can be run without a short landing is provided by the approach created by combining geometrical and mechanical parameter calculations. This gives the opportunity to make more modifications while the well is being drilled.  Generally speaking, the borehole quality used to run the casing has an impact on the ``smoothness'' that links the wellbore geometry and mechanical system used to drill the portion of the well. It is feasible to determine the runnability of the casing for a particular hole size using complex equations represented with common sense and real-time drilling parameters. Wellbore tortuosity, borehole torsion, wellprofile energy, casing push through force, margin of slackoff force, and overpull margin all work together to facilitate the assessment of a suggested wellpath in order to ascertain the runnability of the casing. For operations like running casing in curve building sections or to total depth on lengthy laterals, combining operational experience and trajectory parameters in a methodology has shown to be an effective way to estimate operational risk. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which the runnability metrics can be adjusted in realtime with actual drilling and survey details. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which runnability measurements can be used to predict or identify other difficulties, such as intricate stimulation tasks, artificial lift functionality, and potential well servicing issues that could result from undesired curvature, borehole torsion, and wellbore drift.}

Recent investigations reported by the authors determined that the design of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits has a significant influence on stick/slip behaviour of the drilling systems. Among various bit design methodologies, a depth-of-cut (DOC) control technique has emerged as an effective way of mitigating bit-induced stick/slip. The research reported in this paper aims at enhancing this technique to accurately identify the optimal application of DOC control for maximum reliability and performance.  A comprehensive testing program on a full-scale research rig was undertaken to characterize the optimal type, positioning, and extent of DOC control required for mitigating stick/slip. Several PDC bits incorporating strategically configured DOC control elements were designed and tested. The stick/slip tendencies of bits were determined based on diagnostics from downhole drilling dynamics monitoring devices while the surface operating parameters were varied in a controlled manner.  Test results indicated that certain DOC control characteristics were the most effective in mitigating stick/slip. While under-application of DOC control did not mitigate stick/slip, over-application reduced performance without mitigating stick/slip. Formation type played a major role in instigating stick/slip, and was a significant factor in designing DOC control.  The paper presents analysis details and proposes design guidelines based on testing in multiple formations within three research wells. These design guidelines are also supported by field evidence from the North Sea, where statistics on many bit runs indicate superior performance with properly tuned DOC control.}

	abstract		= {The wellhead is a pressure containing vessel at the top of well and acts as the mechanical connection between well and blowout preventer (BOP), or Christmas tree. Wellheads in subsea wells are subjected to dynamic loading, and consequently fatigue damage, whenever a riser connects a well to a floating vessel. This paper investigates the load distribution and stresses along the components of subsea wellheads installed in a caisson, as an alternative to mitigate wellhead fatigue.  To prevent fatigue-related incidents, operators, suppliers, and classification societies have collaborated to improve the evaluation of wellhead fatigue. A detailed finite element model (FEM) of the wellhead is used to simulate the mechanical response of the system and calculate stress levels at relevant spots. The simulations presented in this study follow the industry's recommended practices to investigate the potential of reducing the loading on wellhead fatigue hot spots by having a caisson installed around the conductor. Different parameters were established to evaluate the sensitivity of the system's response and determine the optimal mechanical configuration.  Caissons have been used to place the wellhead and the Christmas tree below the mud line level, as a protective measure against icebergs in Arctic regions and trawl nets in fishing areas. The results of the presented study case indicate that this practice may be of benefit to subsea wellheads in general. The interactions with the caisson and the thick cement ring between conductor and caisson near the mud line may alter the response of the wellhead to the environmental loads transferred by the riser. While the magnitude of the loading itself is not reduced, its distribution along the wellhead components is. As a result, stresses on wellhead spots particularly vulnerable to fatigue failure, such as welds, may be reduced, while stresses on other, less vulnerable, locations of the wellhead may increase, which still results in a net gain to the overall service life of the product.  Installation of a subsea wellhead in a caisson is a potential fatigue mitigating measure applicable to new wells, either in satellite or clustered configuration. The industry's established experience with similar equipment may expedite the adoption of this measure.}

	abstract		= {Rate of penetration (ROP) represents drilling speed and its productive time during drilling operations in oil and gas wells. A predictive model that links ROP to its influential parameters is essential to optimize ROP for minimizing drilling costs. This study implements a comprehensive data mining approach utilizing Python toolboxes to improve ROP prediction in directional wells, which has not been addressed as much as vertical wells with respect to the downhole weight on the bit (WOB) and cutting transport. To do so, seven functions, including influential parameters, were identified to impact ROP in directional drilling. Drilling data of seven directional wells from an offshore rig in a gas field was compiled to set up the input dataset. The data preprocessing methods, consisting of the modified Z-score and Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter, were utilized to remove outliers and reduce the noises in the input dataset. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and random forest regression models were employed comparatively to predict ROP, and their architectures were designed by tuning hyperparameters of the models. The models' accuracy was statistically and graphically assessed by using the K-fold cross-validation and statistical metrics. The random forest model was demonstrated to be superior to the MLP neural network model in terms of accuracy and speed. The results represent that using calculated downhole WOB instead of measured surface WOB in the input dataset reinforces the models' accuracy in the prediction of ROP. Statistical investigations such as partial correlation, mutual information, and permutation feature importance revealed that the cutting transport function can affect ROP in directional drilling as significantly as other influential parameters, which has not been mainly accounted for in the literature when establishing models for ROP prediction.}

	abstract		= {A drill bit is subjected to rotational speed variation during drilling, ranging from minor rotational speed oscillations to severe speed variation, including stuck phase. The severe speed variation, referred to as stick-slip, is known to be a major source of problems, such as fatigue failures, bit wear, and poor drilling rates. This paper will provide new insight into the mechanisms that drive severe stick-slip based on continuous high-frequency downhole measurements and 3D transient dynamic drilling simulation.  To understand the mechanism of severe stick-slip, a series of drilling tests were conducted at a full-scale drilling test facility. An advanced downhole measurement tool was placed in the bottom hole assembly (BHA) to record three-axis shock and vibration, RPM, bending moment, downhole weight on bit (DWOB), downhole torque (DTOR) and internal and annular pressure at high frequency. The drilling system was then modeled on a 3D transient drilling simulation platform, including detailed bit-rock interaction based on single-cutter tests, the exact BHA, and the wellbore geometry.  The downhole recorded data showed clear coupling of severe stick-slip, axial load, and bending moment conditions. Interesting patterns observed between RPM, DWOB, DTOR, and bending moment will be presented in detail. The recorded severe stick-slip condition was successfully reproduced by 3D transient dynamic simulation, and the torque, axial load, and bending moment variations along the BHA revealed coupling between torsional, axial, and lateral motions of the drilling system from simulation. Bit-rock interaction and drillstring-wellbore contact are the drivers supporting the coupling. It was found that the coupling of three motions of the drilling system is the most reasonable explanation to the self-sustained severe stick-slip condition. This mechanism can explain the field observed stick-slip trend (i.e., the higher WOB and lower RPM tend to increase the risk of severe stick-slip tendency). Downhole measurements and transient 3D dynamic simulation of the entire drilling system are essential to fully understand this mechanism.  Understanding the stick-slip process opens additional opportunities for controlling severe stick-slip. Because the stick-slip mechanism is driven by the coupling of three motions, it is possible to mitigate this condition by breaking the coupling mechanism. For example, a shock sub possibly will reduce the severity of axial coupling due to added axial compliance. Simulation shows breaking the mechanism could reduce the severity of stick-slip. The study being reported in this paper also proved the validity of applying advanced 3D transient dynamic model to obtain a better understanding of drilling system behavior. Drilling simulation might well be an effective way to plan a drilling system and drilling parameters.}

The results of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experiments conducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the details of the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certain of the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematical model can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which the torque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gouging action of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indenting action of the teeth.}

	abstract		= {For well construction, planning is one of the most important phases in the delivery of a well. To select the right engineering solutions, it is important to analyze offset data. It is common for engineers to search, index, and catalog offset data. Today, as it has been historically for the industry, this is mostly a manual task. In the past few years, many advances in the way data have been collected, stored, and sorted have made the data easier to access, but actually determining which data are similar enough to use as offset data is still done manually. In simple cases, engineers draw a circle around the coordinates of the well to be drilled and any data within that circle would be considered offset data. This method considers only the geospatial similarity of the wells, and it is used because of time and technology constraints. In our work, we developed a method for a data-driven solution to this problem of identifying offset data.  Data are critical for producing digital products and services. More than 2 years of research have led to the implementation of a powerful tool that allows users to search all global data to discover similar attributes for oil and gas data. In addition, the method includes the ability for users to define importance or allocate priorities to various features in the data. The mentioned advances in collecting, storing, and sorting data have been a major enabler in the evolution of this technology.  This work introduces a developed framework that aids in identifying offset data by implementing a dynamic data-driven solution to analyze and display the similarity of the offset well data in a new way.}

	abstract		= {With Casing drilling, the casing movement creates interaction with the formation that positively affects how the well is drilled. The casing works as a mechanical tool to plaster the cuttings into the formation face and further harden it by physical contact. The small annulus and pipe rotation creates a powerful centrifugal force that helps distribute the cuttings and seals pore spaces which helps in reducing fluid losses.  Therefore, the uniform orbital motion of casing is a crucial factor to obtain smearing effect. Hence, the current study was undertaken to determine the drilling conditions that lead to a uniform whirling motion for simulating plastering effect while also avoiding conditions that may lead to detrimental vibrations encountered in backward whirling. This study consists of analytical modelling, numerical simulations and preliminary experimental investigations.  A comprehensive analytical model was developed to predict the whirling motion of a rotating casing. The model is close to realistic condition as it considers the effect of different factors of whirling motion including eccentricity, gravity, contact forces and fluid interaction. This model was used to perform a parametric study to determine how different factors affect the whirling speed, also known as the critical speed, of casing drilling assembly.  An energy method was used to develop expressions for critical whirling speed. A parametric study was performed using the kinematic model as well as the energy method to see how different factors affect whirling motion.  Based on the parametric study, it was seen that the critical factors that affect backward whirling motion are contact forces or friction forces. Therefore, it is very important to have an estimate of the side force and coefficient of friction values in order to predict the critical whirling speed of backward whirling phenomena. A simulator based on the transfer matrix method was developed to determine the side forces and contact forces of a complex BHA, which are quite often the sweet spots of backward whirling. The simulator can also be used to get the static deflection profile which can be used to compute the critical whirling speed.  In addition to the static state vectors, we need to find the dynamic state vectors that describe the response of the BHA assembly to the specified excitation for the specified RPM, WOB and other operating parameters. These state vectors can be used for designing BHA so that they are less prone to backward whirling. Therefore, a transfer matrix model was developed for the dynamic Euler equation. Some preliminary experimental tests were performed to evaluate the analytical model.},

	abstract		= {In a pioneering collaboration, a major rig contractor and a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider have jointly created an innovative solution for closed-loop drilling automation. The primary focus of this technology is to achieve cost reduction per foot of drilling by employing a Machine-Learning (ML) based rate of penetration (ROP) optimizer while reducing dysfunctions. This optimizer enables remote control of rig site auto driller setpoints through a seamless cloud-to-cloud connection, without the need for any additional rig devices.  The ML ROP optimizer has been previously published in SPE publications by the SaaS provider, with references (SPE-212568-MS, SPE-208751-MS, SPE-204043-MS, SPE-URTEC-343). A rig contractor developed an Application Programming Interface (API) to receive control setpoints - weight on bit (WOB), ROP, revolutions per minute (RPM), and differential pressure (DPRES) from the optimizer. These setpoints are synchronized between cloud and edge, then to the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), ensuring reliable connection via a heartbeat mechanism. An enhanced auto driller system was deployed to improve setpoint control. Field testing involved a three-well campaign in the Permian Basin, targeting lateral sections in two formations in collaboration with a major Oil and Gas Operator.  Several key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed to evaluate the performance of the automation technology against conventional manual drilling. In Test Well 1, 52\\% of lateral footage was drilled with the automation technology enabled, resulting in a 13\\% improvement in ROP and successful completion of the lateral in a single bit trip. For Test Wells 2 and 3, the percentage of lateral footage drilled with the automation technology was 56\\% and 48\\%, respectively. On-bottom ROP was improved by 25\\% on average after filtering out control drilling for rotary steerable system (RSS) downlinks. For both Test Wells 2 and 3, no unplanned trip occurred.  To mitigate the impact of high vibration during drilling, the vibration filter feature was activated for Test Well 3. This feature avoided sending setpoints that were correlated with recent high vibration. This automated mitigation approach effectively reduced vibration without requiring manual intervention. The remote control of setpoints significantly minimized the need for manual intervention, reducing driller fatigue and allowing them to focus on other critical tasks for ensuring safe drilling operations. The paper will present detailed data supporting the observations.  This paper presents an innovative integration of ML and cloud technologies, achieving real-time control of auto-driller setpoints without the need for additional edge devices on the rig. The seamless cloud connection enables scalable and remote deployment of AI and drilling automation, leading to optimized operations and cost reduction. The collaboration between an operator, rig contractor, and SaaS company sets a pioneering example of closed-loop drilling automation.}

	abstract		= {Cementing is a critical stage in the well construction process, providing zonal isolation, support, and protection for casing. Cement slurry design is a key element in cementing and represents a complex chemical process. Designing slurries with numerous chemical properties is challenging as it must account for often-contradictory requirements. Conventional slurry design relies heavily on using traditional search methods, based on applying numerous filters containing slurry composition, test conditions, additives, etc. This approach is highly ineffective, tedious, and time consuming, and can lead to suboptimal results, because of an engineer’s subjective experience and biases. In this paper we present an artificial intelligence-(AI-)based cement slurry design recommendation system that recommends the most relevant slurry designs based on slurry composition, well conditions, and laboratory test results. The original database contains \textasciitilde{}230,000 formulations and \textasciitilde{}2 million tests completed since 2018. These data are cleaned, preprocessed, and fed into the recommendation system, which is built in two steps. First, vectorization of all historical slurry records is performed with consistent feature engineering. Key slurry features include slurry composition, well conditions, and laboratory test results. Second, these vectors are used to compute similarity metrics between slurry records applying AI-based algorithms, such as clustering, exact, and approximate nearest-neighbor methods. In the inference phase, the system uses the computed similarity metrics to recommend the most relevant slurries for a set of design requirements. The AI-based system is data-driven and objectively recommends the most relevant slurries for a set of design requirements, from the database. A comparative study of the tested AI algorithms and their corresponding outcomes is presented. Specific evaluation metrics are proposed to evaluate the recommendation results. The recommended slurries are visualized in both tabular and graphical forms, for user-friendly analysis. In addition, several examples are provided that demonstrate how this innovative approach improves the slurry design methodology. The proposed approach enables retrieval of the relevant slurry candidates from a huge database in seconds, compared to performing manual search and analysis, which can take hours. The recommended slurries form a solid foundation for later stages of the slurry design process. Furthermore, smart selection of slurries saves many hours of expensive laboratory testing.}

	abstract		= {Utilizing big drilling data requires an innovative approach. The service company’s drill bits business is largely based upon an in-house drilling record system (DRS) that captures global bit record performance data. The DRS contains over 1.8 million wells drilled worldwide since 1980 with nearly 5.4 million total BHA runs from over 100 countries. In the last 10 years alone, over 1.4 million bit runs drilling over 2.8 billion ft of formation have been recorded. To utilize this vast amount of data for drill bit performance evaluation, analysis, and monitoring, the innovative approach described in this paper was developed and implemented.  Traditionally, the performance of a drill bit run\textendash{}often measured in terms of drilled footage and ROP\textendash{}has been evaluated versus similar offset runs. Offset runs are chosen in various ways, but are typically done manually by bit engineers, meaning that offset run selection is subjective based on personal experience and bias. Furthermore, people often only evaluate the performance of test bit designs. Instead, we wanted to analyze and monitor the performance of all drill bit runs. To alleviate these biases and enable a wider breadth of considered runs, an objective offset run selection workflow was developed and implemented within DRS. Offset runs are selected based on a sophisticated filtering and scoring routine that considers many characteristics such as geographic location, time, wellbore and drilling system design, along with lithology. As new data enters DRS continuously, this workflow runs on a regular basis using an automated pipeline.  The performance evaluation results of the automated offset selection workflow are available to all data analysts (engineers and salespeople) both inside DRS and extensible applications to aid in performance monitoring and new product development target-setting. Product performance is now objectively evaluated at-scale across geographies and always utilizing apples-to-apples comparisons. The workflow has proven itself quite useful and delivered business value already but also exemplifies the need for both enhanced data quality and improved bit record data capture rate. These are ongoing efforts to further enhance and improve this workflow.  Automated workflows like this one can help our industry by eliminating repetitive biased tasks and allowing people to focus on more creative processes leveraging objective data. Developing new drill bit designs, material selections, or component selections to overcome new challenges are creative processes which contribute to increased drilling performance and lower costs for the industry.}

	abstract		= {By the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an important climate action, infill drilling in CO2-rich storage sites will be expected. This implies that actions for handling an influx of CO2 into the drilling fluid must be prepared for. This study aims to close some of the many knowledge gaps when drilling for CO2 storage wells.  To detect and handle CO2 well control incidents, it is necessary to develop software tools that take properly into account the properties of CO2 and drilling fluid and how the mixture of the two performs. To support the development of a such tool, experimental characterization of density, rheology, phase envelope, hydrate formation and drilling fluid stability are performed on drilling fluids mixed with CO2 for relevant pressures and temperatures. Based on these experiments and verified thermodynamic model descriptions, local models for properties of drilling fluid-CO2 mixtures are developed and integrated in an existing drilling software suite. Considerations on similarities and differences with natural gas kicks are made.  Results from the experimental campaigns are presented and analyzed with respect to how the drilling fluid properties are affected by the CO2, e.g.: How does the phase envelope of the drilling fluid-CO2 mixture change with different amounts of CO2, i.e., to which degree is CO2 dissolved in the drilling fluid under different conditions, and when is it a free gas or liquid? What is the impact of CO2 on the drilling fluid-CO2 mixture density? Under which conditions will the constitution of the drilling fluid break down, i.e., loss of rheological properties and risk of weight material sedimentation or drilling fluid component separation?Furthermore, we consider how these effects can be captured in local constitutive models and integrated in a hydraulic model that can be used for simulating well control incidents. This study provides new insights into drilling fluid-CO2 interaction that are necessary in order to handle risks related to well control incidents when drilling into existing CO2 storage sites. The outcome of this study will help build experimentally verified model algorithms. Implemented in software tools this will enable more accurate simulations of such events than what is available now, and will help in evaluating risks, precautions and operational procedures associated with handling such events.}

The objective of this paper is to outline the importance of new standards for studying hydraulic sealability of barrier materials, with emphasis on interface analysis. This work reviews different procedures used to study hydraulic sealability of barrier materials. Reviewing current standards and procedures for testing and qualifying zonal isolation materials indicates that the focus is mainly on the bulk properties of cement, such as expansion/shrinkage, permeability, and mechanical strength. The benefits of these standards are to provide reproducible results, consistent testing procedures and prevent misunderstandings about behavior of hardened cement in laboratory and field operations. However, interfaces are complex and cannot be tested with current standards, meaning that mechanical properties alone cannot indicate hydraulic sealability. The review process also includes non-setting materials further indicating the need for updated standards.  Per today, there is published work on sealability testing on the barrier material interfaces, either towards the surrounding rock or towards the casing. This is of particular importance due to more emerging well types such as CCS, hydrogen storage, geothermal wells, and purpose based well integrity and plug and abandonment. A thorough review of sealability test setups indicates that different research groups have designed setups with similar features, but with variations on scale dimensions, testing protocol and so on. This, in combination with the availability of modern measurement technologies, offers the possibility of enhanced understanding of barrier sealability. As no standards currently describe a uniform testing procedure, direct comparison of results is thus inaccurate, putting the reproducibility and reliability of analyses at risk. Our observation shows that possible considerations for standardization include understanding the effect of dimensional scales, the sequence in the procedure, the duration of testing, the type of casing steel or rock, and the type of invasion fluid besides the amount of released heat of setting material. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that current standards are updated to include sealability analysis, and updates for new and alternative materials, such as geopolymers, settled barite, and metal alloys.}

As no standards currently describe a uniform testing procedure, direct comparison of results is thus inaccurate, putting the reproducibility and reliability of analyses at risk. Our observation shows that possible considerations for standardization include understanding the effect of dimensional scales, the sequence in the procedure, the duration of testing, the type of casing steel or rock, and the type of invasion fluid besides the amount of released heat of setting material. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that current standards are updated to include sealability analysis, and updates for new and alternative materials, such as geopolymers, settled barite, and metal alloys.}

	abstract		= {The Mud-Gas Separator (MGS) is a critical component in well control for handling gas kicks. It is the primary device for separating liquid-gas mixtures in most well control events. Poor separator designs and inefficient separation of gases from liquids in the MGS have resulted in the loss of lives and equipment and adverse environmental effects. Thus, the safe and efficient separation of gases from gas-cut drilling fluids in the MGS is vital. The design and operational efficiency of the MGS depend on certain key elements in its sizing, such as the vent line length and diameter, vessel internal diameter, hydrostatic head of the mud seal, and the vent line back pressure, amongst others. These design considerations and the industrial standards and regulations governing them are hitherto not fully understood. As a result, there is an associated risk in the operation of the MGS.  This paper aims to comprehensively review and analyze key sizing and design considerations for the Mud Gas Separator for both Conventional and Managed Pressure Drilling Operations. Furthermore, industry standards, best practices, guidelines, and regulations on MGS design and operations are also reviewed.  This study uses two primary methodologies: an extensive literature review and a stakeholder engagement consultation to meet the stipulated objectives. The results indicate that the sizing and design of MGS depend on various factors such as well depth, pressure and temperature regimes, formation fluid, and completion fluid systems. The study's outcomes also indicate that existing industry standards and regulations provide sufficient guidelines for various sizing and design considerations. The study also presents an analysis of existing industry recommendations on MGS design and sizing for special wellbore conditions, formation properties, and unconventional drilling applications like managed pressure drilling (MPD).  The study provides further understanding of the MGS sizing and design from industry stakeholders’ perspective to minimize well-control risks associated with MGS.}

A field testing program was carried out on a full-scale experimental test rig in the state of Oklahoma, USA, with known lithological formations, in order to evaluate underreaming system designs. In this context, the underreaming system comprised the bit, the drive system, and the underreaming element.  To fully understand how the system interacts with the formation and reacts to inputs from the surface, drilling mechanics measurements were taken above and below the reamer element. Drilling dynamics measurements were also taken at three places in the BHA, with two drilling dynamics packages spaced out below the reamer and one positioned directly above it. That way, dynamics on the bit and reamer could be studied separately to understand how bit and reamer performance affect each other and the overall system dynamics.  The first well was directionally drilled with a rotary steerable system, concentric reamer, and vibration monitoring equipment set up in an industry-standard arrangement. This paper will describe how the findings and learning from the initial field test led to bit redesign and operational techniques implemented to enhance the drilling system stability. Another borehole was then drilled through identical formations with this improved system, offering a unique detailed comparison between the two field tests. The new bit design allowed the bit to control the drilling rate with better weight distribution between bit and reamer, significantly reducing vibration, and in this study, without impacting penetration rate.  A concentric reaming tool new to the drilling industry was used in both wells as a part of this study and will also be described. This tool demonstrated good steerability with a rotary steerable tool system and operated properly, drilling closed, activating, reaming, and finally, closing for retrieval from the hole.}

	abstract		= {The oil and gas industry faces pressure to reduce emissions and minimize fuel consumption to decrease the carbon footprint of drilling operations. Like other players in the sector, drilling contractors have made a commitment to achieving measurable improvements that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the application of new technologies. The challenge is in identifying areas of operation with the greatest potential to deliver efficiency gains and finding ways to realize the reductions.  In evaluating rig operations, it became clear that optimizing engine usage has the potential to deliver considerable cost savings and at the same time improve drilling performance. Ideally, this would mean automating the process, but automating drilling processes is not straightforward. It requires in-depth knowledge of rig operations and an understanding of the interplay between the driller, who controls the drilling process, and the generators that power the rig.  One solution is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze operational data to capture drilling insights that reliably predict power usage, ensuring operations can be executed as planned and that power demand never exceeds power availability. With the introduction of AI on AC drilling rigs, data monitored by the electronic drilling recorder (EDR) can be analyzed to correlate rig activities with power usage, enabling improvements in drilling efficiency and power management. Using AI changes the paradigm, making it possible to proactively forecast and deliver the correct amount of power to the rig as demand changes throughout the drilling process.  This paper delves into the application of AI and automation of the power generation system to demonstrate its impact in revolutionizing drilling operations by forecasting and delivering power needs to deliver efficient drilling programs that use less fuel, produce lower emissions, extend equipment service life, and make fewer demands on the driller and rig crew.}

	abstract		= {To drill deeper and hotter wells, such as for high temperature high pressure (HPHT) oil and gas or geothermal applications, proper management of bottomhole temperatures is critical to ensure survival of electronic tools and to improve drilling performance. The paper introduces a new type of the Insulated Drill Pipe (the ``IDP'') which minimizes heat transfer from the annulus into the drill pipe, to deliver drilling fluid to the bottomhole assembly (BHA) with substantially cooler circulating temperature than using the non-insulated drill pipe.  An iterative design process was followed to develop a robust and cost-effective insulating material that can be applied to the inside and outside of the standard non-insulated drill pipe. After testing a series of different insulating materials in the lab and in the field as prototypes, a new coating system was chosen for the first generation of the IDP. Concurrently, a detailed thermal model was developed to estimate the expected cooling effect of the IDP.  A full IDP string was manufactured in 2022 and was subsequently used in three field trials: a geothermal test well in New Mexico, the USA DOE FORGE project in Utah, and a US-based shale well. During field trials, mud inlet and outlet temperatures and measurement while drilling (MWD) temperatures were monitored. In some cases, mud chillers were used at the surface to decrease the inlet mud temperature. Both real-time and recorded MWD temperatures were obtained. At FORGE, recorded circulating temperatures at the MWD were reduced by up to 42 °C (75 \textdegree{}F), from 107 \textdegree{}C (225 \textdegree{}F) to 65 \textdegree{}C (150 \textdegree{}F) in formation temperatures exceeding 150 \textdegree{}C (300 \textdegree{}F). Analysis of wear and robustness of the insulating material were inspected on all joints of drill pipe and damage in vertical and deviated wells was minimal. High normal forces and friction in a horizontal well did result in significant damage to the coating which can be remedied through improved coating design. The thermal model was validated with the measured data and used to accurately predict the performance of IDP in future runs.  This is the first extended field trial of the IDP, and the results demonstrate the value of the IDP to reduce mud temperatures downhole. The IDP allows for improved cooling of the BHA components, particularly electronics, and extends the operating window of existing MWD, electronic equipment and other BHA tools to deeper and hotter environments. This is critical for the HPHT wells and for deep and hot geothermal wells, reducing the cost of the instrumented BHAs for these wells, while improving downhole tool reliability, and reducing a frequency of tripping operations due to downhole failures. The developed thermal model can also provide maximal connection times by estimating the rate of borehole heating while rig pumps are off.}

This paper evaluates the impact of rapid cooling on rock cutting process, and incorporates this effect as a part of potential drilling performance optimization.  Using data from a series of experiments conducted in a high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) drilling laboratory, we demonstrated that rapid cooling enhanced rates of penetration over 60\% in the 300+ °C hot dry rock utilizing a PDC bit or a roller cone bit. Drilling was performed in hard igneous rock samples, with the unconfined compressive strength over 200 MPa. Each sample was heated and confined to predetermined conditions, then drilled with controlled parameters. The drilling performance data was acquired for each experiment, complemented with dynamic in-situ temperature measurements, and visual assessment of rock samples before and after drilling. The rapid cooling effect on the rate of penetration was found to be a function of the temperature difference between the drilling fluid at the bit face and the rock sample temperatures.  Unlike previous studies on the Drilling Performance, which overlooked thermal effects, our research focuses on the synergy between rapid cooling and mechanical rock cutting process. This study provides a framework to understand and improve drilling performance for HPHT wells, including deep and hot geothermal wells.}

	abstract		= {Drilling systems automation (DSA) involves multiple actors, each delivering functionality at different levels of automation, with system performance dependent on various input from human operators. Current automation classifications do not fully address the multi-agent nature of drilling operations. Marketing language in industry publications has also outstripped reality by boldly describing automated drilling operations as autonomous, leading to confusion. There is a need to define and include autonomous behavior in the taxonomy of drilling systems automation.  A completely autonomous system without direct human interaction may not be a practical goal. Classification into levels of automation for drilling applies to the union of all functions used in a particular operation, and their interaction with humans. Various developed taxonomies showing the transition from manual to highly automated systems use the construct: acquire/observe, assess/orient, decide and act. This paper presents and analyzes taxonomies for their applicability to drilling systems automation, and their use to describe the level of autonomy in this discipline, considering the multi-agent nature and weak observability of drilling operations requiring human consideration.  The authors initially collaborated under the SPE DSATS (Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section) to develop a classification applicable to drilling systems automation — and by extension, completions, intervention, and P\\\&A automation \textemdash{} in which autonomous systems are recognized. The classification distinguishes the multi-agent drilling environment in which one agent may be concerned with hole cleaning, another with automated trajectory drilling, and yet another with optimizing rate-of-penetration, all while acting interdependently.  Depending on the necessary collaboration between agents, this multi-agent construct can lead to a mixed-initiative autonomous system that is able to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the drilling environment. Drilling, however, also has an observability problem that necessitates a more stratified solution to taxonomy due to missing or lacking data and data attributes. This observability problem exists in both space and time: most measurements are at surface, some from the bottomhole assembly; the low bandwidth of traditional measurement-while-drilling telemetry methods delivers sparse measurements.  This paper recommends a taxonomy for drilling systems automation from an enterprise to an execution level that considers the observability problem, complexity, and uncertainty, delivering the necessary capability to accurately classify and address autonomy within drilling systems automation. This taxonomy will greatly reduce the chance of miscommunication regarding drilling system automation capabilities.  The complexity, uncertainty, and sparse observability inherent in drilling suggests that the levels of automation taxonomies adopted in other industries (aviation, automotive, etc.) may not appear directly applicable to drilling systems automation. However, the introduction of three levels of autonomous systems leaves the application of a drilling systems automation levels of taxonomy as an underlying model. A clearly communicated safe introduction of automated and autonomous drilling systems will directly benefit from this industry-specific taxonomy that recognizes the degree of needed human interaction at all levels across all interconnected systems.}

	abstract		= {As operators actively manage their costs of drilling, reducing cost in one area can increase it in another. Millions of horizontal feet drilled across North American shale basins has effectively eradicated existing drill pipe fleets. In addition, the rise of 5-1/2 inch variants in land-based Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells has made drill pipe more difficult and costly to replace, so keeping drill pipe in service for as long as possible is paramount to improving its total cost of ownership as well as to ameliorate the risk of replacement when supply chains preclude availability. In two continuous trials, drill pipe was protected using welded wear bands near the center of the tubes, with the downhole effect on the pipe carefully measured and analyzed.  Using a ground-breaking, low heat input welding process, protective weld material was applied to drill pipe tube bodies used in the Jonah Field and Midland Basin. These protected the most vulnerable areas of the tubes from wear and mitigated DBR/downgrade. The protected drill pipe was thoroughly inspected after being used in both the Jonah Field and Midland Basin, and relevant technical inputs were recorded for every run in the Jonah Field. Extensive measurements were taken of the wear bands run-over-run to evaluate their effectiveness throughout the trials.  The technical need for protected drill pipe was twofold, effective rock destruction when drilling through hard, abrasive sandstone coupled with the economic need to deliver 2-2.5-mile laterals. For the trials, inspections – including dimensional, visual, Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI), and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) \textendash{} were completed on pipe following multiple lateral runs and wells. These data were used to measure and monitor material loss of both the wear bands and drill pipe body and indicated that the wear bands were effectively protecting the drill pipe while wearing at measurable rates. Revolutions, calculated side forces, and lithology were tracked on a run-to-run basis in the Jonah Field to assist with normalizing the measured wear rates and evaluating the effectiveness of the trial wear bands. All this revealed successful runs with the wear bands present.  The value of this improved welding method is that it extends the life of the drill pipe, significantly decreasing the total cost of ownership for operators. Although these trials were limited in scope, a meaningful ROI will be achieved at scale, with all or most of the drill pipe protected with the longest-lasting wear bands. Because the wear bands cost less than 25\\% of a new joint of pipe and allow the pipe to last up to twice as long, this Return On Investment (ROI) is substantial.}

	abstract		= {Model-based engineering has become more prevalent in the drilling industry over the last few decades. While there is great value in using models, a realistic understanding of the types of problems that can be solved with models, the associated cost, and limitations is critical. Understanding these challenges will help facilitate communication, planning, and collaboration. This paper describes some of the challenges to understanding and ultimately automating drilling processes using models.  Examples of models used to solve industry problems are torque and drag, stick slip, surge and swab, drillstring dynamics, and many more. Models may be data-driven, or physics based, steady state or dynamic, high fidelity or reduced order for execution speed and clarity. To learn from a high-fidelity model, data must be collected and fed to the model and parameters estimated to reproduce the behavior of interest. Often there is not enough data to be certain of the relevant dynamics either because of aliasing or sparse sensor placement. Models for control systems and automation must be controllable and observable which means that most of the high frequency dynamics which represent things like high frequency torsional oscillations and whirl are eliminated, high fidelity is not appropriate. Specifying model requirements and modifying existing models to meet those may require a significant effort which should be considered when planning projects.  The goal is to provide an overview of common use cases for models, and a general description of associated model requirements, to illustrate some of the challenges and costs involved in drilling automation. Processes involved in developing models for specific applications are not described in detail. Instead, the reader is referred to relevant literature.}

	abstract		= {Appropriate selection of a bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is critical to the success of a drilling operation.  In US Land drilling, these assemblies are often selected using local heuristics rather than rigorous analysis. These heuristics are frequently derived from the incentives of the directional contractor as opposed to incentives for the operator. Large motor bends enable more rotation though the curve and reduce the possibility of tripping for build rates. Unstabilized motors are believed to aid sliding and tool face control. Both of these practices lead to drilling a more tortuous wellbore and may cause problems later in the well’s life. This study quantifies the impact of these practices and proposes alternatives that can balance the needs of directional companies with the desire of operators for high-quality wellbores. Over 60 conventional motor assemblies used to drill curves in the Eagle Ford and Permian were analyzed for directional performance using commercial drillstring analysis software. The sliding and rotary tendencies were modelled through the curve across a range of potential drilling conditions. Expected build-rate models were validated by comparison to the maximum achieved doglegs in the directional surveys. When available, additional validation was performed using motor yields calculated from slide sheets. The validated models were compared to the dogleg severity requirements for each assembly’s respective well plan. Comparisons of slide ratios and slide/rotate tendencies of the BHAs were used to estimate the impact on wellbore quality using the tortuosity metric proposed by Jamieson (2019).  Typical well plans for both basins had curves of 10 degrees/100ft with no well plan greater than 12 degrees/100ft. Typical bottom hole assemblies were capable of $>$15 degrees/100ft under normal sliding conditions, with some assemblies capable of $>$20 degrees/100ft of build. Predicted build rates were validated by slide sheets and observed dogleg severities. Common characteristics among assemblies with excess capacity were high bend angles ($>=$2 degrees) and minimal stabilization. These slick assemblies also had a strong drop tendency in rotation at low inclinations. The combination of high-build rate with rotary drop greatly increases tortuosity, particularly in the early stages of well. A minority of the assemblies used a lower motor bend angle ($<$2 degrees) combined with multiple stabilizers. These assemblies had a more consistent directional capability throughout the curve and held angle in rotation. The success of these assemblies confirms that a higher quality wellbore with an improved BHA design is technically achievable.  As increasing attention is afforded to the topic of wellbore quality it is important to have methods available to technically achieve high-quality wellbores.  In addition to the management of drilling practices, it is also important to have an appropriate BHA design that can enable those practices.},

	abstract		= {The drilling and completion of oil and gas wells is a collaborative business, involving employees from many contractors working together. Well construction generates many documents that are shared cross-functionally between these different groups. A regulator may receive an as-drilled plat from a well planner, using surveys from an MWD operator, based on a pipe tally from a rig contractor. In this scenario, the person legally specifying the well location has likely never physically seen the wellhead or the equipment used to define the location. The regulatory database might later be used by a different operator for identifying offset wells on a nearby drilling program, further confounding matters. While document sharing is critical for successful well construction, there is often little opportunity for verification before use or transmission to another party.  A review of documents related to well construction was performed. This included plats, well plans, bottom hole assembly reports, directional surveys, and other drilling records. The examination was performed on which data was contained in these documents, how it might be verified by a third party using it, and the potential for errors to arise when the data is received or transmitted. Of particular concern were documents such as well locations and directional surveys which are not only difficult to verify but are also likely to be further shared with additional parties. These documents are frequently the basis for critical decisions related to well construction, implying a strong potential for erroneous data to be used when making those decisions.  For most of the document types investigated, there was little to no standardization on the content or format of the data presented. Similarly, when documents contained redundant data (such as a well name across a directional survey record, bottom hole assembly reports, and well plans) there was often inconsistency in how that data was presented. While in many cases the accuracy of the data may still be unverifiable, several good practices for identifying gross errors in documentation and preventing erroneous data from entering a curated database are presented. Examples include ensuring personnel are trained in the significance of the data being received and requesting redundant data whenever possible so internal cross-validation can be performed for data consistency.  Data quality processes for internal workflows have long been a focus for the industry. As more systems become increasingly connected, a similar amount of attention must be paid to external workflows, where if care is not taken data of unknown and unverifiable quality may be used to make critical decisions.}

	abstract		= {During well planning, specifying the separation that must be maintained from offset wellbores is critical to ensuring safe operations. Recent efforts on API RP 78, an upcoming recommended practice for wellbore placement, have provided guidelines for calculating safe separation distances and engineering considerations for those calculations. A major milestone was the publication of a separation rule (Sawaryn, et al. 2019) standardizing a formula for separation factor (SF), which in turn defines the minimum allowable separation distance (MASD) between two wellbores and the allowable deviation from plan (ADP) for a wellbore being drilled. One element of this formula, spa, describes the accuracy with which a future wellpath can be predicted. Prior guidance provides a suggested value for spa (1.6ft or 0.5m at 1-sigma) based on heuristics. A more rigorous approach for estimating this value is presented, where the design of the drilling program can be considered.  A framework is proposed for modeling deviation from a projected path using a planned trajectory, bottom hole assembly (BHA) properties, and survey practices. The method identifies where a deviation is detected through survey measurements and estimates a planned recovery operation. Equations are provided for estimating the distance from plan at deviation detection along with the maximum expected deviation during recovery. Common drilling scenarios are analyzed for sensitivity to operational parameters such as survey course length, sensor offset, toolface control, and BHA performance. The impact of varying spa is explored across prototypical collision avoidance cases. A discussion of the relationships between the spa value and the common collision avoidance calculations such as SF, MASD, and ADP is included along with considerations for the design of a risk management policy.  Survey course length, survey sensor offset and uncertainty in directional performance are all shown to have a significant impact on the potential maximum deviation from plan. An additional factor considered is the aggressiveness expected when performing recovery operations. An analysis of common drilling scenarios suggests the previously provided guidance of 1.6ft at 1-sigma appears suitable for cases where the directional behavior of the BHA is well characterized and the combination of course length and survey sensor offset is kept to 150ft or less. Longer survey course lengths, larger sensor offsets, or uncertainty in directional performance of the BHA can produce larger spa values, in some scenarios causing a significant impact on the MASD and ADP.  Previous work has called attention to the uncertainty in drilling to a projection, but up to now there has not been a rigorous method for estimating that quantity. With the methods outlined in this paper well planners and drilling engineers can make more informed decisions on how to ensure safe separation practices in their own operations.}

	abstract		= {A new mathematical model is developed for the nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation is based on a three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, rotary steerable systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied to a wide range of drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome parasitic axial drag acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable mud motor in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to \pm{} 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions.}

	abstract		= {Battery energy storage systems (ESS) have been proven to significantly reduce emissions and fuel consumption on drilling rigs since the industry's first system was deployed in 2018. These systems leverage their stored energy to reduce the number of generators online and operate the remaining generators at high load where they are most efficient. Control methodology has traditionally required at least one generator to be online to follow the grid formed by the generator(s) and bias the load higher or lower. However, during operations where power demand is lower than the capacity of a single generator, the battery becomes fully charged leaving the system with no mechanism to artificially increase generator load. This results in a single generator running at low load for extended periods of time.  A new automated energy-saving feature, characterized by the absence of ambient noise typically associated with generators, was developed to address this issue and create opportunities for additional fuel and emissions reductions. When the system determines that the operation will not require significant power consumption for an extended period, it will automatically initiate a shutdown of the last online generator and switch to the automated energy-saving mode, using only the batteries to form the electrical grid and supply power to all rig equipment. The rig will continue to operate in this mode until the battery state of charge drops to a certain threshold, at which point it will automatically launch a generator. When the additional generator comes online, it will run at a high load for a brief period to quickly recharge the battery. This accomplishes both goals of reducing generator runtime and increasing average generator load.  A calculated approach was necessary to maximize the time in the energy-saving mode while avoiding any impact to operations. Additionally, the control scheme was designed to minimize the number of generator starts while taking precautions to stay within the discharge limitations of the batteries. This feature was deployed to the fleet of ESS, resulting in additional fuel and emissions savings not possible with the traditional systems. Factors including ambient temperature and the operator-specific drilling program produced a wide range of efficiency improvement across the fleet.}

	abstract		= {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has become a critical strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and achieving environmental sustainability. In-situ stress determination plays a pivotal role in the success of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) initiatives. It is a fundamental component of ensuring the safe and reliable containment of captured carbon dioxide within underground storage reservoirs by enhancing the integrity and stability of reservoirs, minimizing the risk of potential leakage, and optimizing the placement and design of new CO2 injection wells. In summary, in-situ stress determination serves as the cornerstone of secure and effective CCS operations, underlining the critical importance of comprehensive geomechanical assessments for a sustainable carbon reduction strategy.  In this integrated approach, we conduct comprehensive stress testing measurements and integrate them with various openhole log measurements, including acoustics, imaging, caliper data, geomechanical analysis. The integrated workflow is designed to assess both the near-wellbore and far-field environment by analyzing axial, radial, and azimuthal waveforms recorded by borehole acoustics tools. Notably, variations in radial shear slowness serve as indicators of stress concentrations around the borehole, allowing for the estimation of stress magnitudes within anisotropic sandstone bodies. Multi-arm caliper and image analysis are crucial components of the stress testing process, providing insights into stress regime and direction. To further refine our stress testing, dynamic stress tests were conducted, offering valuable calibration data for minimum horizontal stress estimation. The accuracy of our workflow is validated through the analysis of pre- and post-stress test image logs.  In recent times, there has been a growing trend in incorporating mechanical earth models (MEM) into the assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage feasibility. These models play a pivotal role in estimating the integrity of the cap rock for CO2 storage and conducting feasibility studies for hydraulic fracturing to enhance injectivity. The integration of MEM into our workflow facilitates a comprehensive analysis of subsurface conditions, enabling informed decisions regarding CO2 storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. These methods are instrumental in accurately assessing the level of horizontal stress, a verification process that involves rigorous leakoff tests, formation integrity tests, and an analysis of microfracturing results.  This study highlights the significant potential of this integrated approach for in-situ stress characterization in CCS formations. It not only contributes to safer and more efficient carbon storage but also offers a foundation for informed decisions regarding wellbore stability and hydraulic fracturing operations, critical elements in the success of CCS initiatives. Ultimately, the integration of stress testing with acoustic logs, borehole image logs, and geomechanical models represents a robust strategy for achieving a comprehensive understanding of subsurface stress, addressing a fundamental aspect of CCS implementation.}

	abstract		= {Data is one of the most important limiting factors of deep machine learning (ML) model in drilling applications. Though a big size of historical data can be available, high-quality cleaned and labeled data is usually limited. In this case study, we show that with limited labeled data, physics-based data augmentation combined with unsupervised learning significantly improves both stability and accuracy in bit wear ML model. It provides a pathway to overcome labeled data shortage and field data quality limitations.  Labeled bit wear data is usually limited because only the final bit dull state can be labeled using dull photos for the entire drilling distance. To overcome this difficulty, an encoder-decoder unsupervised ML framework based on Bi-directional LSTM architecture is first applied to the data of entire drilling distance to extract and maximize data learnings. Then, a physics-based wear estimator is implemented in the learned latent space to augment labeled wear dataset, guided by true wear labels and offset-well data. Weighting factor in loss function is applied to optimize augmented and true datasets in final supervised learning step.  The proposed real-time bit wear model is built on a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning method. The model is applied on multiple field bit runs. Results show that by implementing the unsupervised data learnings only, the prediction accuracy is improved by 30\% compared to the baseline ML model. By combining physics-based augmentation, the accuracy is further improved by 10\%. More importantly, adding physics-based data augmentation significantly reduces prediction variance and unphysical wear outputs, therefore improving prediction stability by more than 30\%. It should be noted that the prediction stability of AI/ML model is crucial in real-time application and decision making. The results show physics-based data augmentation not only increases the size of label dataset and prevents model overfitting, but also applies physics-based guidance to the ML model effectively. It is learned weighting factor plays a crucial role in balancing loss contributions from true wear labels and physics-based labels. While low weighting factor of physics-based labels diminishes the augmented data, high weighting factor disrespects the true wear labels leading to a high prediction bias. Overall, the bit wear model study shows physic-based data augmentation combined with unsupervised data learning can effectively improve model accuracy, stability, and overcome labeled data shortage difficulty.  The proposed paper shows a case study for the bit wear ML model using a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning. While labeled data is one of the major challenges of ML models in many drilling applications, this study provides a pathway to improve both accuracy and stability of deep ML models with limited labeled data.}

	abstract		= {Downhole vibrations can lead to significant drilling problems in unconventional wells, such as frequent tool failures that increase drilling costs. Detecting these vibrations during drilling is crucial for enhancing drilling practices. One of the most destructive types of downhole vibrations is torsional stick-slip, characterized by fluctuations in bit rotation speed between zero and several times the surface rotation speed. Typically, surface data is used for real-time diagnosis of this drilling dysfunction. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based detection algorithms have increasingly been proposed in the literature.  However, a key drawback of AI methods is their limited applicability to wells in the same field with similar geological formations and bottom-hole assemblies (BHAs). This paper aims to address this limitation and explore solutions for generalizing these approaches. It does so by employing appropriate data normalization methods, transfer learning, and the inclusion of physics-based features. Using historical offset well data, this paper presents trained and tested machine learning models capable of predicting the stick-slip index (SSI) using sequences of surface measurements and physical features. This model can be deployed in real-time on drilling rigs to provide diagnostics and recommendations.}

	abstract		= {In today's well construction operations, a substantial volume of data is generated and stored across multiple databases. The primary objective being to use them as a guide for future well construction optimization. However, much of this data gets lost in computer storage, and appropriate information is difficult to find at the right time. This paper shows the results of deploying a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) large language model on an operator's dataset to alleviate this problem.  The process starts with gathering all relevant data into a common database. In this case, the dataset included sensor data, processed data, morning reports, end of well reports, after-action reviews of non-productive times, bit forensics data and publicly available data from wells drilled by other operators. The files were pre-processed, and metadata was added appropriately to ensure appropriate indexing and training of the information. This data is then fed to the cloud platform on which the model is learnt. The model is then integrated into the data platform so that the end users can pose queries.  The dataset consisted of more than 200 wells of the operator in a region that the operator is actively drilling. Data curation was a time-consuming task that had to be performed to ensure only quality and organized information was fed to the model. Documents containing well construction related subject matter were also used in the training to provide the end user assistance with core concepts. During the test stage, a multitude of questions were posed to the platform, including questions such as: What happened the last time there was a stuck pipe in this region? What is the best ROP that could be attained in the lateral section? Significant time savings were recorded due to the ease with which information could be retrieved. A big concern was the potential for wrongs answers being provided to the questions. To alleviate this concern, all answers were accompanied by references found in the database, to give the person reviewing the answers confidence in the answers.  This paper introduces the benefits that large language models (LLMs) bring to both well planning and real-time operations. LLM offers the capability to be able to retrieve information extremely quickly and provide answers in a conversational format to user questions. This paper also provides recommendations to the industry and details some of the challenges to adopting LLMs.}

	abstract		= {It is challenging to optimize operation procedures that safely remove riser gas without causing equipment, personnel, or unnecessary environmental issues. This paper presents results from studies of various scenarios using a fixed-choke constant outflow (FCCO) method that will keep the choke opening constant to measure fluid outflow while circulating the riser gas out through the booster line.  A commercial dynamic multiphase flow software program was used to study extreme scenarios of up to 300 bbl of gas influx in the bottom of the riser of a deepwater rig equipped with a riser gas handling system or managed pressure drilling (MPD) system drilling in 12,000 ft of water. The consequences of gas migration and free gas dissolution into both water-based and oil-based mud were studied. The initial fixed-choke opening was selected by modeling a 500-gal/min flow rate through the boost line with a choke sized to initially obtain from 150 to 200 psi surface back pressure. The pump rate was reduced to 200 gal/min or even 0 gal/min as needed to keep choke pressure; hence, the return flow rate is relatively equal to the initial target value. Other scenarios with different influx volumes and choke openings were also studied to check pressure consequences to the riser system.  When using the FCCO method to manage the 300 bbl influx with water-based mud, the software calculated a maximum pressure of 580 psi on the riser top. When using oil-based mud, a maximum pressure of 1,112 psi was observed on the riser top for the same scenario. When the same situation was simply shut in (instead of being circulated using the FCCO method), there was a maximum pressure of 2,300 psi on the riser top with water-based mud, but only 1,254 psi when using oil-based mud, ignoring for the moment the benefit provided by pressure relief valves in an actual operation, which could intervene before the riser top pressure reaches 2,300 psi.  The analysis of the resulting surface choke pressure and surface gas/liquid flow rate support the concept that circulation of the gas influx while adjusting pump rate to keep the flow rate constant through a choke at the fixed position (even if it means reducing the pump rate to 0 gal/min as flow is driven by gas expansion alone) would be easier to handle than by using other proposed riser gas management procedures.  This paper presents the first study of riser gas handling in an oil-based mud scenario considering gas dissolution with an FCCO and provide references for International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) riser-gas handling guidelines and deepwater well control guidelines.}

	abstract		= {The soft string model has been widely used for torque and drag calculations. Although several modifications have been developed, the standard model in the oil and gas industry is the static soft string model, in which the string is assumed to be motionless and its stiffness is neglected. In order to estimate more realistic and accurate calculation of drillstring loading, not only the acceleration, but also axial stiffness of the string must be considered in force calculations. In this paper, a dynamic, axially-stiff string model is presented for force calculations of drillstring in tripping operations.  The mathematical model is developed to include axial stiffness of the drillstring and acceleration into the soft string model by coupling mass-spring system with the soft string model. Moreover, static friction and drilling fluid drag are taken into account. The drillstring is considered to be a system of coupled oscillators subject to external forces. Then, the motion of the individual oscillator is governed by external forces and the forces applied by its two neighboring elements. In this model, the static friction effect is included as a constraint for initiation of motion.  The drillstring configuration is considered to be drillpipe, drillcollar, and directional assembly. The developed model ("new model") is implemented for tripping-out one stand in two ideal directional wellbores plus one field case wellbore trajectory. Axial force behavior shows a trend of acceleration that is similar to that observed with the previous dynamic soft string model ("previous model": SPE-173084-MS), and the first peak contains the effect of static friction. Displacement at the end of the string shows that the whole drillstring is in motion after few seconds. The axial force using the new model is compared to that (axial force) calculated using the previous model for two different cases. In the acceleration part of the motion, the new model shows a peak about 12\\% higher than the maximum load in the previous model which is due to the static friction force. In the constant velocity part of the motion, depending on the amount of damping, the new model can show a result similar to that of the previous model.  The new dynamic axially-stiff string model provides a more realistic prediction of hookload, and consequently more realistic loading of the hoisting equipment and fatigue life of the drillstring. Other applications of this model are for wellbore planning, drillstring design, optimization and automation of tripping operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes an alternative formulation of the nonlinear equations governing the coupled axial and torsional dynamics of a discrete model of a rotary drilling system equipped with a drag bit. This model assumes a rate-independent bit/rock interface law that accounts for both cutting and frictional contact processes. The regenerative effect associated with the cutting introduces a term with delay, and thus a feedback, in the equations of motion, while the frictional contact results in set-valued contact forces and discontinuities in the boundary conditions, which are responsible for the occurrence of axial and torsional stick-slip oscillations. Inspired by P. Wahi and A. Chatterjee (Self-interrupted regenerative metal cutting in turning, International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics 43:2, 111–123, 2008), the regenerative effect is captured by a bit trajectory function, whose evolution is governed by a first order partial differential equation. With this approach, the original state-dependent delay differential equations (SDDDEs) governing the dynamics of the discrete model are replaced by the partial differential equation of the bit trajectory function together with the axial and angular equations of motion of the two degrees-of-freedom model. The equation governing the evolution of the bit trajectory function is further approximated by a system of first order ordinary differential equations through application of the Galerkin method. The introduction of the bit trajectory function makes it possible to consider a bit with two state-dependent delays (and in principle multiple delays) without reducing the computational efficiency. The accuracy of this approximation is validated using published results, and the convergence and robustness properties of the proposed method are analyzed using three cases corresponding to different regimes of instability. Finally, we extend the discrete model to a more generic lumped-parameter model with multiple degrees-of-freedom, which captures the propagation of axial and torsional vibrations along the drillstring.}

	abstract		= {The parallel track scraping principle of conventional PDC bits largely limits the cutting efficiency and working life in deep formations. Cross-cutting polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit may be an efficient drilling tool that increases the rock-breaking efficiency through both cross-cutting and alternate-cutting modes of the PDC cutter. The motion track equation of the cross-cutting PDC bit was derived by using the compound coordinate system, and the motion track was analyzed. Meanwhile, through the unit experiment and discrete element simulation, the cutting force, volume-specific load, and crack propagation were analyzed under different cutting modes. Through establishing a nonlinear dynamic model of the bit-rock system, the speed-up mechanism of the novel bit was analyzed based on rock damage, rock stress state, and motion characteristic of the bit during the rock-breaking process. Compared with unidirectional cutting, cross-cutting produces less cutting force, more brittle fracture, and a greater decrease of formation strength. The novel PDC bit can put more rock elements into a tensile stress condition than a conventional PDC bit, and the plastic energy dissipation ratio of the cross-cutting PDC bit is lower while the damage energy consumption ratio is higher than they are for conventional bits, which is beneficial to increasing the ratio of fracture failure and improving rock-breaking efficiency. Laboratory drilling tests show that the cross-cutting PDC bit can create mesh-like bottom-hole features. Drilling contrast experiments show that a mesh-like bottom-hole pattern can be obtained by using the cross-cutting PDC bit, of which the ROP is obviously higher than that of the conventional bit when drilling in sandstone or limestone formation. Meanwhile, the influence of deviation angle, weight on bit, and rock properties on cutting efficiency of the cross-cutting PDC bit are studied.}

	abstract		= {Drilling is an essential operation for subsurface hydrocarbon/geothermal energy extraction or underground waste fluid/gas storage. Efficient drilling is the key to an economically viable operation. Axial, torsional, and lateral oscillations that are excited in the drillstring by various surface/downhole sources (like the application of the weight-on-bit (WOB), rock cutting process, bottom-hole-assembly (BHA) resonance, downhole tool operation, drilling fluid dynamics, etc.), are the prime causes of downhole tool failure, material fatigue, bit wear/damage, and insufficient surface-to-bottom energy transfer. Since the 1960s, a wide variety of models have been developed to analyze drillstring dynamics and optimize the well/drillstring design. With the advance of drilling engineering, sensor technology, and data science, a fast and comprehensive drilling system dynamic model is in need for real-time drilling optimization and automation.  In this study, a control-oriented physics-based lumped parameter model (LPM) is developed to investigate the fully coupled drillstring dynamics in all three directions. Various boundary conditions (wellbore-drillstring interaction, bit-rock interaction, presence of stabilizers/centralizers) and system input actuations (surface WOB/hookload, surface rotational speed (RPM)/torque, mud motor operational parameters, etc.) are defined in the modeling framework. Simulations are run for different drillstring scenarios in a vertical and an actual L-shaped wellbore configuration. System dynamic responses illustrate various amplitudes, frequencies, and modes of fully coupled drillstring vibrations at different depths when simulated with different drilling parameters. Another significant observation is the emergence, propagation, and transition of lateral vibration modes between forward, backward, and chaotic whirl patterns. Based on the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, the proposed dynamic model can be adapted for real-time model-based control, and can also be deployed for well design purposes or digital twinning applications.}

	abstract		= {Wells with compromised integrity can cause groundwater/soil contamination and increased carbon emissions. Given that there are more than 3.7 million abandoned wells in existence, preventative and remedial operations will need to be prioritized based on the current and future state of well integrity. Well integrity risk assessment, therefore, plays a critical role in managing abandoned wells. This paper presents a generalized workflow for risk assessment that can be applied to abandoned wells in any region.  This study introduces a data-based workflow to project wells onto a risk contour map with a leaking risk gradient as an indicator. The methodology calls for utilizing various feature-rich datasets obtained from multiple sources. Two datasets were used in this study for the purpose of demonstration, including a publicly available dataset consisting of 2342 wells and a newly collected dataset containing detailed information on 1047 wells in the San Juan Basin in the State of New Mexico. The inputs considered for the risk assessment model based on machine learning (ML) included well longitude, latitude, total injected or produced fluid throughout the well's lifetime, distance to induced seismic activity, well lifespan (age), TVD, surface casing bottom depth, production casing bottom depth, completion length, oil price, sacks of cement used to cement the surface casing, abandonment date, cement thickness, and target geologic reservoir formation. Five ML models (artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting classifier, and logistic regression) were trained, with the artificial neural network classifier showing the best performance with an initial 75\% accuracy. This artificial neural network model was re-trained for regression, which allowed manual threshold setting. This increased the prediction accuracy to 85\%. A leaking risk contour map with risk gradient indicators was created by applying the artificial neural network regression model.  This approach provides an essential tool for guidance on wells with compromised well integrity that need to be permanently abandoned or re-abandoned, and wells with sufficient long-term well integrity such that they can be considered for re-use and re-purposing as wastewater / CO2 / hydrogen storage wells, geothermal wells, gravitational energy battery wells, etc. This issue is particularly important given the large asset retirement obligations (ARO) faced by oil and gas operators, presenting major capital expenditures with little-to-no return on investment (ROI) if all wells are to be abandoned. Considerable ARO reduction may be achieved if wells with sufficient integrity can be re-purposed.  Reducing uncertainties associated with well integrity and generating a risk contour map provides valuable insight for asset management of wells to be either abandoned or repurposed and empowers decision-makers to prioritize resources efficiently. This paper provides an easily reproducible data-based approach for identifying wells with different well integrity risk profiles. This paper also highlights features that should almost always be considered in any well-integrity study.}
