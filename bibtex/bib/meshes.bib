	abstract		= {Two general algorithms for refining triangular computational meshes based on the bisection of triangles by the longest side are presented and discussed. The algorithms can be applied globally or locally for selective refinement of any conforming triangulation and always generate a new conforming triangulation after a finite number of interactions even when locally used. The algorithms also ensure that all angles in subsequent refined triangulations are greater than or equal to half the smallest angle in the original triangulation; the shape regularity of all triangles is maintained and the transition between small and large triangles is smooth in a natural way. Proofs of the above properties are presented. The second algorithm is a simpler, improved version of the first which retains most of the properties of the latter. The algorithms can be used either for constructing irregular computational meshes or for locally refining any given triangulation. In this sense they can be adequately combined with adaptive and/or multigrid techniques for solving finite element systems. Examples of the application of the algorithms are given and two possible generalizations are pointed out.}
