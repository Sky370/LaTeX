This document is a supplement the code comments.  It contains equations which are hard to express in code comments.  It also contains high level design intentions.

This document is for software developers is \emph{not} intended as a user's manual.

    \section*{Creation of This Document}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Creation of This Document}

This document was created using \LaTeX\index{Latex@\LaTeX}\@.  \LaTeX{} is standard with most \emph{Linux} installations. You can download a \emph{Windows} version as part of the \href{http://www.miktex.org/}{\emph{MiKTeX}} (www.miktex.org)\index{MiKTeX} project. A useful interface to \emph{MiKTeX} is provided by \href{http://www.winedt.com/}{\emph{WinEdt}}  (www.winedt.com). The \class{.dvi} viewer (\emph{YAP}) that comes with \emph{MiKTeX} requires the use of \href{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/}{\emph{Ghostscript} and \emph{Ghostview}} (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/) \index{Ghostscript}\index{Ghostview} in order to view \class{.dvi} file produced by \LaTeX\index{Latex@\LaTeX}~\cite{ref:kopka1999a}.

This document was built from many files.  The files or file types are listed below, along with a description.
    \begin{bulletedlist}
        \item The class file \class{book.cls} which contains common formatting.
        \item A main \LaTeX{} file, \class{\documenttitle.tex}, that initializes the document and inputs the remaining source files.
        \item A bibliography file, \class{le.bib}, that contains references in a format \LaTeX{} understands.
        \item A \emph{WinEdt}\index{WinEdt} project file, \class{\documentshorttitle.prj} (not required to build the document), used by \emph{WinEdt} to store project settings.
        \item Batch files, \class{run\ul{}make\ul{}document.bat} and \class{run\ul{}manual\ul{}make\ul{}document.bat}, used to build the file (but not required), see below for more information.
        \item \LaTeX{} chapter files, (\class{.tex} files prefixed with \class{CH}), included by the main file.
        \item \LaTeX{} section files, (\class{.tex} files prefixed with \class{SC}), included by the chapter files.
        \item Additional miscellaneous \LaTeX{} files used as needed, (\class{.tex, .sty}).  See comments in the source for explanations.
        \item Graphic files included by the \LaTeX{} files (see below for more information).
    \end{bulletedlist}

This file was built using the \class{makedocument.bat} batch file.  The batch file was created to allow passing additional parameters to \LaTeX{} and \emph{BibTeX}\@ that would otherwise require manually adding each time a build was performed.  (\emph{WinEdt} does not seem to provide this functionality.)  The parameter to include the directory for common files like \class{lebook.cls}, \class{le.bib}, and \class{leplain.bst} is passed this way.  These files were kept separate so that this manual and others can both access them (without keeping multiple copies).

    \subsection*{Additional Graphics Information}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Additional Graphics Information}

The \LaTeX{} file has been set up to produce both \class{.dvi} and \class{.pdf} formats as output.  There are a few issues that are associated with using graphics with both \class{.dvi} and \class{.pdf} files.

The graphics used to generate the \class{.pdf} format must be in either \class{.pdf} or \class{.jpg} format.  Some figures are of the \class{.eps} format (they are small, in vector format, and work well with \LaTeX) and as a result need to be converted to work in the \class{.pdf} output file.  Versions of the \class{.eps} files in \class{.pdf} format can be created the batch file 
	\begin{plainlist}
		\item \class{manual\ul{}convert\ul{}all\ul{}images.bat}
	\end{plainlist}
located in the same directory as the figures.  See the batch file itself for more details.
