INSTALLATION:

1) To enable MiKTeX to use the files in this directory, install the "C:\Custom Program Files\LaTeX" 
   directory as a TEXMF directory.  Choose "MiKTeX Options" from the program files directory and 
   then choose the tab "roots."

   
2) Follow the instructions that are printed at the end of the "Make TT Fonts.bat" file in the "TTF 2 TFM Work" directory.
   It shouldn't be necessary to run the file, but it will not hurt anything to run it.
