\section{About LeLaTeX}
\lelatex{} is the author's customize \LaTeX{}\index{Latex@\LaTeX} classes and styles combined with some additional processing commands.  It has been developed through the years to create a standardized way of generating documents.

While it is open-source and anyone is free to use it, the library was never intended as a general library; it was created for personal use.  As such, it does not have extensive documentation.  It also may change without notification or regards to backwards compatibility.

For most users, it may be most beneficial as a reference library or to select particular style files and customize them as needed. 

\section{About this Document}
This document serves many purposes.  They include:
\begin{bulletedlist}
	\item Provide installation instructions.
	\item Provide an example documented that can be used as a template.
	\item Provide a reference for the syntax used by the author.
\end{bulletedlist}

While these are not topics that would typically be combined, they are all somewhat short.  Therefore, the decision was made to combine them into a single document.
