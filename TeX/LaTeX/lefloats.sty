% FLOATS.
% From: http://dcwww.camd.dtu.dk/~schiotz/comp/LatexTips/LatexTips.html#figplacement
% LaTeX's figure placement algorithm is quite biased in favor of putting figures on a page by themselves,
% instead of on the top of a page with some text below it. Often, I find the result aesthetically unappealing
% (to be polite). Fortunately, the parameters of the algorithm can be changed. The main problem is that LaTeX
% per default only allows a part of the top of a text-page (70%) to contain figures, and requires at least 20%
% of a page to be text when text and figures share a page. These parameters should be set to more reasonable
% values, for example 85% and 10%.
